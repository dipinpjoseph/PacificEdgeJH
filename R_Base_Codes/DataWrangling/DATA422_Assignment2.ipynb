Avoid plagiarism: if you are not sure what may constitute code plagiarism, read this http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mtaylor/ponline/index.php?id=source-code-plagiarism. Remember, when in doubt **declare your sources**.  \n",

The pace of the course is very quick, and you don't want to be working on this too long, as you would have less time for other assignments. I suggest you to submit what you have ready by the time the assignment is due, even if it is not everything we required.

It's possibly one of the best films of its kind, and I especially liked the development of all the characters. The villain isn't just a villain. I understood him. Like all Marvel films, the visual and aural elements are excellent. Acting and writing are top notch here as well. This film is a bit more serious than most Marvel films, which works in its favor.t was about time we saw a Marvel superhero blockbuster starring mostly African-American actors and achieving the success and popularity that it did - and even better is how great it is, with a thrilling climax and relatable characters that compensate for a couple of flaws in the script.When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here.With a superb soundtrack and great performances from Michael B Jordan and Danai Gurira, this, for me, is the most enjoyable Marvel movie yet.  With none of the forced humour it shows stronger storytelling instead which keeps you gripped until the end.</td><td>\"Black Panther\" lived up to the hype.When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, \"Black Panther\" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender.Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times. And the final scene isn't the requisite pause before the next Marvel movie, but a genuine Moment. It's an emotionally rousing expression of why this movie matters, flaws and all.It's a powerful package.Black Panther is one of Marvel's best movies to date and Ryan Coogler has delivered something which is going to have a lasting impact not only on comic book fans but an entire generation. Wakanda Forever!Spectacular diversity magic! Black Panther slashes a lot of things, chiefly colonialism. In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him.</td></tr>\n",

Easily one of the greatest action films ever made. Right up there with Terminator 2!Mad Max is back in this Sequel/Reboot that blows the other Mad Max films out of the water, In a matter of fact it blows most action films out of the water too, This beautifully shot masterpiece has some of the best action scenes, Car chases and stunts that I've ever seen, It hardly slows down for nothing but when it does we do have an interesting but familiar plot that works very well, Tom Hardy was great fun as Max I wouldn't mind seeing him take up the role again, The effects and practical effects were all amazing, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but I'm betting the 3D would of been great, It's not often a film lives up to the hype but Fury Road is a film that all action fans should watch as it's a modern day classic in many ways.With lots of thrills and top notch action sequences Mad Max Fury road never fails to disappoint.George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run.                                                                               \n",

       "The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie.  This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.</td><td>Happy end of the world.Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance.Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller's action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.Fury Road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee-led blockbusters which are built on CGI and designed to sell toys.Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off.I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around, when I'd adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle - not to mention the hilarious sexual politics.Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once.It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it.Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to \"dumb fun.\" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent.Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy.The sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking, and Miller's singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty.Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing, but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes.</td></tr>\n",

Gal Gadot.Before I start with my thoughts on this and everything surrounding, let me just say that, FINALLY, the DC Extended Universe gets one right with this movie.  You don't know how long I've been waiting to say those words.  Though, to be fair, after The Dark Knight Trilogy (THE best superhero trilogy bar none), I haven't kept up with any of DC's efforts to create its own massive universe.  I find Superman to be interminably boring, so I had no interest (outside of Michael Shannon) in seeing Man of Steel.  DC, in my opinion, made the wrong choice to keep Batman dark and brooding after The Dark Knight Trilogy so, again, I had no real interest in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice outside of maybe seeing Wonder Woman.  DC has done a poor job at building its own extended universe so, once again, I had no interest in the Justice League movie.  You see how it is.  Of the movies in this universe, the only one I've seen was Suicide Squad, which, while decent, wasn't good and squandered its potential.  Wonder Woman was the only shining beacon of hope in the horizon, the chance to (finally) do a female superhero movie right.  Elektra and Catwoman both sucked and Marvel, since their ascent, wasted their chance to be first in this race by not doing a Black Widow movie.  Here's the thing though, before I get to Wonder Woman, and I've mentioned this a lot, but DC Comics is essentially playing catch-up with Marvel.  That's why you see them bumbling and fumbling major movies, because they know they have to catch up, since Marvel has, pretty much had a monopoly on this superhero movie business since Iron Man came out in 2008.  The thing about Marvel is that they knew they couldn't rush things, they had to slowly plant the seeds for something bigger and, now, you see that that patience has paid off immensely.  I don't know how much money the MCU has raked in for Disney (and this is counting merchandising, DVD sales and other forms of revenue), but it has to be a multi-billion dollar franchise for Disney.  DC hasn't had the same patience, as they're following the same template without understanding why it worked in the first place.  It can't be all at once, it has to be done little by little.  Rome wasn't built in a day and DC has attempted to build Rome (with its extended universe) in 20 minutes.  But, at the same time, DC wasn't always a point of mockery.  DC characters were the first to make the transition from comic to successful major motion pictures with Superman (in 1978) and Batman (in 1989).  Marvel was playing catch-up to DC in the era following Batman's successful release.  They released some truly awful movies in the 90s, like Captain America in 1990 and The Fantastic Four in 94, which was so bad that it hasn't been released yet.  There may have been others, but those are the major ones that pop to mind.  So, in DC's defense, they can still make something of their universe.  But, and to me this is most important, the whole thing needs to not be so dark and serious.  Marvel has succeeded in large part because they know how to pace their movies.  They know that you need comedy in movies like this.  It can't be all darkness and brooding characters struggling with their own moral dilemmas about what is right and what is wrong.  The whole look of the films also needs some more life injected into them.  Marvel movies are diverse in settings and cinematography, so, in spite of being set in the same universe, the MCU films feel different tonally and visually.  In the DC, every movie sort of looks the same.  With a dark, grey and blue hue.  And, as great as this movie is, once they get to London, it's really more of the same in terms of visuals.  Having said all of that, let's move on shall we?  I'm honestly quite surprised that DC waited THIS long to make a Wonder Woman movie, particularly when, to me, this is the movie that should have started your whole extended universe.  This should have been the starting point for all things DCEU.  Firstly, if we're doing this in chronological order so, technically, this should have been first and, secondly, it's a great movie, so you start off with this and people would actually be pumped for the DCEU instead of looking at things so cynically now.  Because as things are now, Wonder Woman feels like the exception to the rule that DCEU movies aren't exactly good.  It's an asterisk.  And that's not to minimize this film's significance, because I do like the shift and I feel that DC knows that, at least for this moment in time, Wonder Woman is its most important character.  People have seen Superman and they've seen Batman and that's not to say that they're tired of the same shit, because there's still many fanboys/girls out there, but I think people want something that's new in that universe and Wonder Woman provides that for people.  So that's why, in my opinion, DC needs to worry far more about Wonder Woman, as she needs to be their top priority, for your cinematic universe going forward as opposed to the old, familiar faces.  Having said that, let's get going, shall we?  I think first I need to talk about Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman.  At first, honestly, I didn't get it.  Don't get me wrong, Gal Gadot is a very talented and attractive woman, but I just didn't get IT for the longest time.  But, having finally seen her as this character, I understand the decision to cast her in the role.  Firstly, for some reason or another, she's even more stunningly beautiful as Wonder Woman than even I imagined.  Plus, honestly, I find she brings all the values to the character that she needs.  So, in my opinion, it's a good combination of both.  Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) herself comes from a long line of Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus in order to protect mankind, really, from itself.  Ares, the god of war, being tots jelly of humanity, decided to plot its destruction by influencing them and his influence leading to the humans starting wars against each other.  Ares has also killed all of the gods with the exception of Zeus himself.  Zeus used the last of his power to wound Ares and making him retreat.  Long story short, Zeus essentially hid Themyscira (the island the Amazons live in) to keep from Ares from finding it and left them a weapon called the Godkiller for Ares' return.  Blah, blah, blah, long story short, Steve Trevor (an Allied spy) crashes his plane off the coast of Themyscira, wherein German soldiers follow him and there, they fight against the Amazonian women who, after losing some of their own, including Diana's aunt, defeat the German soldiers.  Steve, after telling them about the Great War (WWI) attempts to enlist the help of the Amazonian women in order to turn the tide of war, but Hippolyta (Diana's mother) has none of it.  Steve has found this notebook by this German doctor that tells of an attempt to create a deadlier form of mustard gas, which he's trying to put a stop to or else millions more will die.  Diana, being incredibly idealistic, figures that this is Ares' return to the world of men and she needs to put a stop to it by killing Ares.  Diana eventually does leave with Steve, she'll never be able to return to Themyscira again as a result.  So, eventually, Steve and Diana make their way to London, where they begin their plan to fight back against the Germans (pre-Hitler) and attempt to put a stop to this deadlier mustard gas.  I will say that the movie does miss a chance to tell an incredibly interesting story of Diana having to adjust to the gender differences once she makes it to London.  Women aren't allowed in the military, they're not even allowed in this war council to discuss an armistice between them and the Germans.  Diana, of course, finds her way in this meeting and she browbeats one of the generals for being a coward, acting as if the lives of his soldiers are less important than his own and not fighting alongside his men.  Women, at least in this point in time, have not been allowed the vote either.  And, honestly, it would have been incredibly interesting to explore that dynamic of Diana, coming from an island where women are clearly superior in every way (even though there's no men) to a place where women are so clearly oppressed.  There's a few hints of it here and there, but I think the movie would have benefited from exploring that dynamic a little bit more, in my opinion.  One of the things I liked about this movie is that, unlike a lot of superhero movies, I do think they try to give a face at the people that are being affected by the war and how that motivates Diana to try and help them, whether it's by driving the German soldiers from this small town or getting rid of Dr. Maru and Ludendorff, the ones not letting this armistice go through and who are also developing the deadlier mustard gas.  There's an interesting debate here that, honestly, I wish the movie would have stuck with.  There comes a point, much later in the film where Diana kills Ludendorff, as has been her goal all along, since she feels Ludendorff is Ares and killing him stops the fighting.  She does, in fact, kill Ludendorf, but the fighting does not stop.  In fact, you could argue, that it gets worse.  Diana questions Steve about why the fighting hasn't stopped and there's a discussion between the two where Steve says that, maybe, just maybe that's just how we are, we're (hard)wired to self-destruct.  There's just something to the idea that Diana believes that only one person is to blame for all of this and by stopping that one person stops the war itself.  It's an interesting idea because it brings to mind the questions that, really, maybe we're not really worth saving in some way, if all we do is keep killing each other every few years.  Not many superhero movies deal with this topic in this way.  But, of course, you could say that it's a bit of a red herring given that, in fact, Ludendorff was not Ares and, instead, was someone they considered an ally.  But it's interesting to explore regardless, given that Diana is still so naive about certain things in 'modern' times and how her idealistic values and ideas aren't shared by everyone around her.  I think that's probably one of the best thing this movie does, just sort of explore the idea that not everyone shares Diana's values and how, in a way, her views are sort either antiquated, ahead of their time or both.  Steve, who's been helpful to her every step of the way, does stand in her way in some scenes before, of course, Diana takes matter into her own hands.  Diana and Steve's relationship is also one of the strongest points of the movies.  This is in large part, of course, to how great Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are, their chemistry is excellent and, while the movie does contain a romantic angle between the two, it doesn't feel forced or unnatural.  As I mention, Gal Gadot's performance is very strong.  She's a badass, but she also brings heart and life to the character.  She's not necessarily a goody two-shoes like Captain America, but they share some similarities in how they view the world.  You can see how people would be drawn to her kind and compassionate nature and that's not something that, say, a lot of actors playing superheroes are able to capture.  The film does have a good bit of action and it is pretty damn good all things considered.  There were some parts that I felt were too Zak Snyder-y, like the whole slo-mo things that Zak Snyder abused in 300.  But, at the very least, in this case, it can be explained by the fact that one of Diana's superpowers is seeing bullets in slo-mo, which allows her to deflect them before they harm her or anybody.  So, at least, it's not a stylistic choice that was abused, it has actual significance.  The action gets a thumbs up from me as if that wasn't obvious.  So you know how I mentioned earlier that the movie touches on the fact that, maybe, humanity isn't worth saving if all we are is doomed to destroy ourselves.  Well, later on in the movie, Diana comes to the realization that, in spite of everything, humanity is worth fighting for.  One of the things I didn't like, there's actually a couple of minor issues I had, is the fact that the whole ending of Diana saying that she believes love will end up saving us is really kind of corny and cheesy.  Not that the message isn't a worthy one, it's just how it's handled.  And, really, Steve's ultimate act of sacrifice was one made for love, so it makes sense that Diana would believe that, it's execution is still a bit corny.  Another thing that bothered me is that, ultimately, the fighting DID stop after Diana killed Ares and, I don't know, I feel like that's too simplistic of a conclusion for something as complex as the first World War.  I like the earlier themes which, while certainly more bleak (and that's something DCEU could do to remove from its movies), it's still a better conclusion and, at the same time, Diana can still come to the same conclusion she did as a result of Steve's actions.  Minor issues, really, as it didn't really affect my overall enjoyment of the film.  Having said that, do I think that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made?  No, not really.  It's the best movie based on one of DC's properties since the Dark Knight Trilogy finished off in 2012.  It's a great superhero movie, with a strong origin story at its core, great performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and a more humanistic approach to its conflict, in that the people Diana and Steve are trying to save aren't entirely faceless as they usually are in these movies (even in the MCU).  But, at the same time, there's nothing really about this movie that extends the boundaries of what we know the superhero genre to be.  It works solely within that framework.  And there's nothing wrong with that but, to me, the best superhero movies transcend their framework to become something more, something fresh within this genre and, honestly, I don't think this offered anything fresh.  Maybe that's just me.  Regardless of all of that, this is still a great superhero movie and, as mentioned, this should have been DC's first step in their attempts to create their own cinematic universe.  As such, we cannot turn back time and, as I mentioned earlier, Wonder Woman should be DC's top priority right now.  Wonder Woman needs to be the centerpiece of their extended universe if they want to come close to rivaling Marvel.  Or even just being a strong number 2.  They're number 2 by default, but they're not a strong number 2.  With that said, this is a great start to this franchise and I'm eagerly looking forward to more from this character and how DC decides to expand the character.  I would easily recommend this.The fourth movie in the current DC extended universe that has been exploding onto our screens with much aplomb. Well actually no it hasn't but that was the idea wasn't it. So far things have been a bit dodgy to say the least, could this movie turn the tide? Well according to just about everyone this movie did seem to do just that. So has the movies popularity, hype and praise swayed me in any way? Is it justified? Or do we have yet another [i]Ghostbusters[/i] (2016) scenario? \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie is basically a prequel to the 2016 movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' whereby it shows the origins of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), whilst at the same time connecting to the events that occur within BvS. The fact its this way around is of course due to WB's lack of patience and coordination in their comicbook universe building (playing catch up with Marvel as fast as possible). The plot however pans out as you might expect, in the usual comicbook fashion. We learn about Diana's homeland, her culture and people. We learn about a pending almighty evil that threatens everything. Outsider shows up and ends up helping Diana in her quest to find and eliminate evil. A bit of exposition, some minor alternate bad guys to deal with, a few key battles and then one big CGI finale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Much like the recent 'Kong: Skull Island' (2017) I had an initial problem with the fictional Amazonian homeland of Themyscira. This place appears to be a very large group of islands plopped in the middle of an ocean somewhere. The problem being it appears to be hidden by a perpetual weather system and some kind of invisibility force field. Obviously this is a fantasy movie so something like this shouldn't really matter. But the entire notion that no one has ever stumbled across this rather large place, and reported it, just seems completely unbelievable. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that when German forces actually find this location (whilst chasing a downed Steve Trevor), they simply start to attack! Why would they do that?? Such an important discovery like that. Also what exactly happened to the German ship? Did the force field sink it?\n",
       "\n",
       "The story moves swiftly on as we follow Diana and Steve (Chris Pine) back to London (its 1918). The plan: Steve simply wants to hand back some important stolen information regarding Nazi gas weapon advancements (Steve was an undercover spy). Where as Diana wants to find the evil God Ares and kill him so she can stop WWI. Diana has basically been brainwashed all about Zeus and his dastardly son who wants to wipe out mankind (Zeus' creation) because he thinks they are a destructive race. She believes Ares is the cause of WWI and she can stop it. The thing this narrative becomes extremely annoying truth be told because Diana never shuts up about it. \n",
       "\n",
       "Diana is essentially very naive and genuinely curious about this new outside world. She clearly has no idea of gender, society rules and the fact that people might treat each other differently. She finds these human elements and more (such as not helping people in need or acting carelessly with other lives), completely reprehensible. She simply does not understand how people could act this way. The thing is, I found it quite grating after a time because Diana mentions it in almost every scene! I fully understood the need to show and express her emotions on these factors but Jesus, you can truly feel Steve's frustration as he tries to help and explain to her. Good acting? Sure, still annoying to listen to over and over though.\n",
       "\n",
       "This being a 2017 movie I also understand the requirements for diversity and whatnot. So when it came to Steve's little band of merry men, naturally they were gonna be a diverse bunch. I had no problem with this except for a few tiny details. Firstly, the crazy Scot, surely they could of cast someone other than Ewen Bremner, such predictable and safe casting. Then my other gripe was the native American character. No problem including the guy, but did they have native Americans in the trenches in WWI? Hey I could be wrong but this kinda felt like they were going for a bit [b]too[/b] much diversity there. Kinda reaching a bit methinks. Also would they really wear their native attire? In other words would Sameer from Morocco (I'm guessing) go around wearing a fez in a wartime situation? Would the Chief Napi go around dressed like a cowboy or hunter? Shouldn't they be wearing protective clothing? Yeah I'm being picky I know.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have to admit the Wonder Woman theme tune is very catchy and it does work well here. The action scenes are very well executed and look terrific, but when that score kicks in it does get your adrenaline fired up a bit that's for sure. The entire movie looks good in general but I put that down to the charming period setting of the early 1900's and WWI. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has noticed that movies shot during either world wars always seem to look very authentic and adventurous. Indeed this movie like others ('The Rocketeer', 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark/Last Crusade', 'Captain America: The First Avenger' etc...) looks authentic, adventurous and harrowing all at the same time. There is a fine balance between the horrors of war and a rollicking comicbook yarn, and its upheld nicely here. Dare I say a bit darker than the first Captain America movie.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think its safe to say the best sequence is where we get our first glimpse of Wonder Woman in battle. She disrobes in front of the stunned allied troops and simply strolls out into no man's land sword and shield at the ready. Other than that things tended to get a bit CGI obvious for me. In the first battle Diana is leaping around like a frog and merely throwing Germans all over the shop. I'm sure they would have been killed or badly injured but it felt like more of a cop out in the heat of the moment. I wanted to see her run troops through, slice n dice. The German soldiers also became obvious CGI ragdolls once launched.\n",
       "\n",
       "The finale was also a bit weak in my opinion. Firstly Diana kills off the main German baddie (Danny Huston) on a packed base, yet no one seemingly cares. Then she fights Ares who turns out to be the elderly David Thewlis! Now don't get me wrong, it was quite refreshing to see a villain not played by some roided up meathead. But watching Thewlis become this electrical power wielding super God was a tad silly. Twas also a bit silly seeing these two superheroes slug it out on one side of this military base; then on the other side mortals are fighting their puny war. Oh and Diana lets the evil Doctor poison go in the end too? Like wut??!! Is that female privilege?\n",
       "\n",
       "So was this as good as all the hype? Yes and no for me. Its certainly a solid superhero flick, its better than virtually all the DC offerings, and it gives some Marvel efforts a good run for their money too. The main problem for me is simple, superhero fatigue. There have been so many of these movies now, and most are generally the same spiel. Its really hard to watch a single superhero movie now and [b]not[/b] think I've seen it all before. But that's because I have, you could essentially swap out Wonder Woman here for any other superhero character, and it would still work the same. So yes its a good solid movie, but its nothing special, it does nothing overly original.The movie is at its best when it focuses on the quieter character moments and when it embraces the weirder elements of the comics (the prominent use of the \"Lasso of Truth\"  is wonderful) some of the action sequences are a little flat but that's to be expected.</td><td>As befitting the genre, Wonder Woman is heroic and spirited. The fighting sequences are spectacular, and the story is engrossing, uplifting and fun. There's even a bit of romance and humor amid all the action. [Full review in Japanese]\"Wonder Woman\" is a superhero movie, and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre, but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy.Beauty, strength, goodness, bravery: These are your values, and here is how your values must look.Jenkins tries not only to include men on Wonder Woman's side but also to make male viewers feel better about a woman saving them.The final big action sequence, as now seems always to be the case, is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones, even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions.Wonder Woman embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace in a mainstream delivery system. And the female lead is not solely a mother, sister, girlfriend or hooker, however gold her heart: wonder of wonders!Gadot - who I'm not yet convinced is a great actor - is one hundred percent perfect in this role, to the extent that it would be a much poorer movie without the zeal and charisma which she brings to the titular Princess of the Amazons.Not a great film, but it is a good one.Not only is Wonder Woman an action film for all ages and genders, but it has a great positive message: no matter how ugly the world gets because of war and dictators, we must be good, protect one another and do right by one other.The superhero film is dripping with engaging characters and you find yourself engrossed with the story. But the film takes a sharp detour in its second half to unveil something incredibly formulaic and predictable.A triumph and the first truly great DC Films release, Wonder Woman exceeds every expectation and stands tall as one of the greatest superhero movies of all-time.Its brain, sense of spectacle, its excellent visual and its approach to an icon of popular culture place it as one of the best superhero movies since 'The Dark Knight' of Christopher Nolan.

I suppose you could make the argument that this heavy focus on sequels started with Toy Story 3, but I don't like to count that since, unlike the other sequels they've done since, it felt like a natural continuation of the story established in the previous films.  Toy Story 4, in my opinion, doesn't make sense because, to me, they've already finished that story and that narrative.  While I've no doubt that Toy Story 4 will deliver the goods, there's no real angle to justify a sequel, creatively at least, since, again, the toys got the send-off they deserved in the third flick.  That's neither here nor there, I suppose, but it's obvious that Disney has pushed them towards this route, given that sequels are easier sells than original films, with all the merchandising deals they can make.  I felt that Pixar even hinted at this with a character in Cars 3.  I'm not getting into that, since I already went over it in the review for that movie.  But, again, it's been a really long time since, to me, Pixar felt like Pixar.  As great as Inside Out and Finding Dory were, I felt like they were a step below Pixar's standards.  Inside Out had some repetitiveness and Finding Dory, well, it was great, but it just wasn't excellent.  Having said that, Inside Out was great and it showed that Pixar's true passion lies in creating new stories and exploring new horizons.  While I had my issues with Inside Out, it was a glimpse that Pixar still had it in them to create stories that really do hit home.  Particularly Inside Out since, essentially, it was a movie about mental illness, a very real topic.  And it explored that topic with all the intelligence and warmth we've come to expect from Pixar.  This brings us to Coco and, goddamnit, if this isn't the best movie Pixar has made in, honestly, almost a decade.  Toy Story 3 (a modern classic) was released 8 years ago and nothing of theirs, since then, has even come close to that.  Well, that is, until this little gem of a movie came along.  I suppose I should get this out of the way first, and it might be a controversial statement to some (particularly if you're a crackpot right-winger), but Mexican mythology/folklore is superior to its American equivalent in every way, shape or form.  I'm not talking about one country being superior to the other, that's not what I'm saying at all (though the U.S has one MAJOR, orange flaw in their midst).  What I'm saying is that stuff like this, that explores Dia de los Muertos and its significance in that culture is so rich and detailed and, really, there's nothing that can even rival that in the States.  There's nothing.  I'm willing to wait it out if you do have something that comes close to that or the decorative skulls and, again, its significance to that culture and the Dia de los Muertos.  There's a movie similar to this one, called The Book of Life and, really, the similarities are skin-deep, because while the movie definitely delves into the other side, where spirits of the dead go after they, you know, die, I think this movie goes into more detail regarding the day and the offerings people make in order to, quite literally, allow their loved ones to visit them and see how they are doing.  This is one of the more important aspects of the movie, since, if a person does not have a photo of them put up as part of an offering, they can't cross to the other side and see their living loved ones.  Another important thing to note is that the dead aren't in the 'other side' forever.  The moment the last person who remembers them is gone (as in dead) they fade away into who knows what.  This is important to the narrative.  Anyway, let's move on.  The movie looks at Miguel, a 12-year-old kid who wants to be a musician when he grows up.  There's just one caveat and that is that his great-great-grandmother banned music in their family when her husband, a musician, abandoned her with her daughter to pursue his dreams of becoming famous.  Miguel, disillusioned but not giving up, has a guitar stashed away in a secret room along with video tapes of his favorite singer/actor/everything awesome, Ernesto De La Cruz.  Long story short, Miguel finds a photo that leads him to believe that De La Cruz is a relative of his.  After an incident where Miguel's grandmother breaks his guitar for refusing to listen to her, he runs away to a mausoleum, where De La Cruz's coffin is at, complete with his signature guitar.  He takes the guitar, stealing from the dead on the Dia de los Muertos, is a big no-no, so he is sent to the other side.  This is where he meets his long-dead relatives (whose photos are on the offering table their family has set-up).  Basically, being sent back to the land of the living, Miguel just has to get a blessing from one of his relatives.  His great-grandmother does so on the condition that he give up music.  Miguel reluctantly agrees, but proceeds to take the guitar and is, again, sent back to the land of the dead.  This is where the movie picks up, with Miguel going on a journey to find De La Cruz in order to get HIS blessing, since he approves of Miguel pursuing his career.  Miguel teams up with a trickster named Hector, who apparently knows De La Cruz.  Hector helps Miguel on the condition that, when Miguel comes back to the land of the living, he put up Hector's picture on the offering table, so he can come back to the land of the living and see his daughter one last time.  The thing about the movie and its narrative is that it is very easy to figure out what the 'twist' is gonna be.  And, you know what, I felt like that didn't actually hamper my enjoyment of the movie at all.  In fact, in some ways, I felt that it added to my enjoyment.  Exploring the theme of death in a film like this, one that's aimed at a family audience, is definitely very tricky.  Obviously you have to do it in a way that teaches you something about who we are as human beings and how we treat our dead.  Also, it's intriguing because, again, movies like this just try to shy away from that theme, but not this flick.  I guess it's because, death, is an inherent part of Mexican culture.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, in the slightest, it's just that, if you're a believer, then death really isn't the end.  Regardless of whether or not you can interact with your deceased loved ones, you can, according to the offerings, allow them a glimpse into your life to show them that, still, you have them in your hearts and your thoughts.  And, really, as much as I'm not a superstitious man, I find that there's a lot of beauty in that.  Beauty that is explored thoroughly in this movie cause, in spite of it all, this is a story about family and the love of that family keeping the spirits of their deceased loved ones alive.  As far as the narrative goes, again, there's some predictability, but that doesn't detract from how emotionally engaging the movie really is.  Hector is a man that you sympathize with and, this might be very spoiler heavy (YOU'VE BEEN WARNED), his journey to see his daughter one last time is emotionally heart-wrenching.  Hector is a man, who was murdered by De La Cruz (who stole all his songs and became famous off of them), who just wants to see his daughter one last time.  Which is what he was about to do when he was poisoned by De La Cruz.  There's something he mentions, since it's teased that Hector is just about to fade away (given that his daughter is dying) and it's that the only chance he has to see his daughter and, the moment she dies, is the moment he fades away.  So he can't even see his daughter in the land of the dead and there's something, honestly, quite heartbreaking about that.  He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.  That's why you sympathize with him and root for him all the way until he finally gets his wish to be put up on an offering table to visit his family on the Dia de los Muertos.  The movie, obviously is steeped in Mexican culture and, while I'm not Mexican, you can see that these people really fucking did their research.  It's not an exploitation of that culture, it is a celebration of the culture and everything that encompasses it.  And I think that's the best thing about this movie, because there's a certain apprehension one feels when you hear that Pixar is tackling Mexican culture in one of their films.  You just feel that they might not get it right.  But, again, in my opinion, they did a wonderful job at exploring the culture, it doesn't poke fun at the superstitious nature of the people and, again, it just celebrates the beauty (really) in the Dia de los Muertos celebration.  Of course, and this should go without saying, that the animation is, literally, out of this world.  I can't even imagine how gorgeous this movie would look on a 4K television.  But it's not just the beauty and, again, this is something that I've mentioned a lot in my Pixar reviews, it's just the amount of detail they put into even the tiniest of things.  And, honestly, it's the sort of thing that you'd really have to watch the movie multiple times to catch on.  There's a reason these people are the best at what they do, because they've got some of the best animators working for them.  I honestly can't rave enough about them.  As I mentioned, the story goes to some very interesting places and it's a very engaging film from beginning to end.  Of course, the movie being the way it is, there's some very emotional moments.  But, again, it doesn't feel unearned.  The film's world is so well-constructed and the characters so well-developed that it doesn't feel manipulative in the slightest.  Miguel singing Hector's song that he wrote for his young daughter who's now, clearly, in her 90s and nearly dying is...oh god, the feels were too strong with that one.  But, again, in spite of that and those definitely very emotional moments, it all adds up to a lovely and beautiful result.  Death, in this universe and culture, is not seen as the bad thing that it is in the U.S.   It is just the next step and, as long as you keep their memory alive in your hearts, then they'll always be there.  That sounds very cliched, but it's a sentiment that this movie explores beautifully.  The voice acting is excellent, as it almost always is in these movies.  The kid who plays Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) is tremendous, Gael Garcia Bernal is tremendous.  To avoid repeating myself too much, everyone here is tremendous as far as voice acting is concerned.  I don't really know what else I can say about this movie.  I'm not saying this is one of Pixar's best because, considering their track record, it's not.  But it's also not far from that level either.  This is a fantastic movie and, really, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss out on this, particularly now that it's on Netflix.  Highly recommended and I loved absolutely every second of this.This may actually be PIxar's least funny film, but that's beside the point. It actually succeeds in everything it sets out to do: tell a beautifully animated and deeply touching story while paying respect to a fascinating Mexican tradition. The visuals are breath-taking and the story so sweet, you have to admire that the film somewhat holds back on the usual slapstick and sticks to its very humane message. Adorable and a feast for all senses!Coco is an extravagant tale of culture and ambition that's exemplary in all aspects: sights, sound and story. The film touts its vibrant layout, rhythmic vibes and overall heartfelt tone that hits home deeply and more uniquely in a fashion befitting of Disney &amp; Pixar . 4.97/5</span></td><td>At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar, after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995), is finally eating itself. At best, well, it's a superbly polished, technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?Funny, irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times.This is a charming and very memorable film.Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough.Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes.Of every Pixar film that deals with family, memory, and loss, ask, \"Is there sufficient reason for the tears that will inevitably run down my face by the end?\" Yes, thanks in no small part to the ingenious use of De La Cruz's hit song, \"Remember Me.\"It is gorgeous and stunning, but will also make sure that you will be ugly crying and calling your family members after the film credits start rolling.It is fun when this is the proposal, vibrant when it wants to be, and it hits us right in the heart when it decides it is time to make us cry. [Full Review in Spanish]It's not the best the studio has put out, but it's certainly the most emotionally wrought. It's almost hard to believe this is a movie for children.A fun, tender and bright adventure that, at the rhythm of 'Ranchera', excites and invites you to hold your tears as only the best films do. [Full Review in Spanish]Coco will tug at your heartstrings as it explores a culture often neglected, and a narrative that is incredibly important in the hopes of continuing the trend of cultural exploration ( ... ).The story's metaphysical slant lends the proceedings a haunting and ruminative air.</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>Dunkirk</td><td>188042171</td><td>107</td><td>Warner Bros. Pictures</td><td>Jul 21, 2017</td><td>Christopher Nolan</td><td>From Christopher Nolan comes the World War II epic Dunkirk.  It doesn't really have a plot as such, but instead attempts to recreate a visceral experience as it following an anonymous soldier on the beach waiting for rescue, a pilot patrolling the sky, and a civilian boat captain making way for Dunkirk in response to the government's call for aid.  There isn't very much dialog, and what little there is is rather incidental and only reveals fragments of the Dunkirk battle/evacuation.  However, Nolan conveys so much through his use of the camera and the images, that little is needed.  The desperation and enormity of the situation comes through, and is quite powerful.  Despite its lack of narrative, Dunkirk is a compelling war film.Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.Christopher Nolan's latest offering is an accurate representation of an event that occurred in 1940 during WWII. British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. \n",
       "\n",
       "Situated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue. Up to 400 various manned craft were voluntarily used and braved the English Channel along with various military vessels. Despite the fact that German forces had halted their crushing advance on Dunkirk (giving the Allies some time to organise the evac), the Luftwaffe were still hitting the port and its beaches and enemy troops were still on the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nolan's film tells the story of Dunkirk from separate angles, land sea and air. The first angle is from a young British private called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who has survived a recent German ambush and has made his way to the beaches. We follow Tommy as he tries to get on-board a couple ships only for them to be sunk by German attacks. Tommy eventually ends up back on the beaches with some Scottish soldiers and a French soldier. The second angle is from RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and two other Spitfire pilots who are part of the British airborne resistance against the German bombers. And the third angle is from a Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son Peter and his sons best friend George. All of whom have volunteered to help in the rescue with the aid of Mr. Dawson's yacht.\n",
       "\n",
       "First off Nolan's film is not like most traditional films. There is very little dialog throughout the entire runtime; instead Nolan relies on pure visuals and the musical score to convey the films atmosphere. That is where the film may be problematic for many people, this isn't a war movie filled with blood, guts, gun battles and explosions. Obviously if you know about the actual historical event then you would know to expect this. The most dialog comes from the story surrounding Mr. Dawson and his son Peter, second to that would probably be Tommy's story, then lastly and most obviously is Farrier's story which is almost entirely conveyed through Tom Hardy's facial expressions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now whilst I did fully appreciate Nolan's vision here, I have to admit to finding it somewhat odd watching a movie like this with little dialog. Looking at Farrier's story (the air section), it was indeed very impressive to watch these old Spitfires dogfight with German Messerschmitt's. Naturally it wasn't shot in the typical Hollywood action sequence type way. What you get are highly realistic air sequences which show the planes trying to manoeuvre into position to be able to attack each other. When the attacks come they are short bursts with very little fanfare. When a plane gets hit nothing much happens at first. The pilots communications are brief and not filled with silly quips. Basically overall it kinda feels like you're watching some kind of airshow display or training video, the fact everything is shot in natural light kinda adds to that.\n",
       "\n",
       "The story surrounding Tommy is probably the most Hollywood-esque part of the movie, but it still may not please some. Once again this is a highly realistic vision, there are no 'Saving Private Ryan' sequences on this beach. The plot is straight forward, Tommy and another soldier try to board ships by using an injured soldier as their ticket essentially. That seems almost wrong but in the grand scheme of things who wouldn't do that? The fact that they try to get away twice and both times the ships are sunk did seem almost too unlucky to me. The fact that later on they reach another ship and yet again it gets sunk, kinda felt a bit overly dramatic perhaps. Did that many ships get sunk in the real event? \n",
       "\n",
       "Tommy's tale certainly has the most cinematic visuals of the film, the numerous shots of the troops lined up on the beach are incredibly haunting, yet beautiful. Its easily the most intriguing of the three main plots but at the same time its also a bit too 'Spielbergian' methinks. When Tommy meets up with the Scottish soldiers things get a tad by the numbers and a little dull. I also felt the death of the French soldier (who was thought to be a Brit) was again a little touch of Hollywood which maybe wasn't required. It was too predictable, the minute he is exposed as French you kinda knew his number was up. I should add that whilst all this is going on we get little snippets of Kenneth Branagh as a Commander overseeing the operation from the beach. Again like Hardy he tends to emote through facial expressions more than dialog. \n",
       "\n",
       "For me the weakest of the stories was following Mr. Dawson and his son. Call me shallow but this was simply because it wasn't really that interesting. I found myself yearning for the plot to get back to the beaches, or in the air with Farrier. Don't get me wrong, Mark Rylance puts in a great performance as the calm and steadfast Dawson, and its important to see the civilian angle of this story. The thing is it just wasn't really that intriguing watching this trio sale slowly towards Dunkirk.\n",
       "\n",
       "The subplot of them rescuing a stranded officer (Cillian Murphy) from a shipwreck was also something of an odd addition. Murphy's officer is shell-shocked, he argues about going to Dunkirk and tries to stop Dawson. This leads to George (Peter's best friend) falling and badly injuring his head...which leads to his eventual death! I really didn't see the point in all this because it goes nowhere. Dawson and Peter lie to the shell-shocked officer about it and that's kinda that. Neither Dawson or Peter came across as upset when the incident occurred or when George dies. You're left wondering what happens with that. Does the officer get done for murder upon return to England? Would he be let off because of the fact he was shell-shocked?\n",
       "\n",
       "Would I say this is one of the greatest war films ever made? In terms of realism yes. In terms of score, cinematography and craftsmanship yes. In terms of engagement (for me the viewer) I'd say its up there, but maybe not the best. I totally and utterly shower praise on Nolan and co for their vision and what they have achieved here, the authenticity being the number one factor of course (score not far behind). But I cannot deny the film is a little slow at times. I hate myself for saying this but I did find myself yearning for just a touch of romanticised heroism or emotion just to get those waterworks going. \n",
       "\n",
       "The final sequence showing Farrier taking out one last German bomber before he is forced to land in enemy territory from lack of fuel, was so fecking awesome. Seeing the Spitfire land in one shot on the Dunkirk beach was fantastic, as was seeing a stoic Farrier stare into the camera as he is captured and led away. But dagnabbit Chris, I just needed a hint, a mere drop of glossy sentimentality. The film was [b]so[/b] realistic that it didn't really feel like a film at times (again I hate myself for saying this). But bottom line, this film is a tour de force that ignores manufactured heroics and stereotypical Hollywood-isms.It's gripping, perilous and uniquely envisioned. Dunkirk blends the fine direction of Christopher Nolan and the captivating historical event to put you on the edge emotionally. 4.5/5</td><td>Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.Few films have stripped war down to its terrifying, thrilling essence as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, and few films have turned war into such an overwhelming, almost physical experience.Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.It isn't a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing.\"Virtual reality without the headset\", [Nolan] calls it, and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen.Occasional bursts of flames, imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters, come as a relief from the chromatic tedium.Nolan has managed to make a masterpiece in a genre crowded with masterpieces, one that will likely be held up as one of the best ever about World War II.[Dunkirk] is massive and impressive.Nolan's knack for 'sculpting in time' reaches a new apex. Dunkirk is to Nolan as 'David' is to Michelangelo. It's his masterpiece.From the artful cinematography to Hans Zimmer's disorienting score, and the non-linear narrative to the dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk is a practice in the bursting through the boundaries of filmmaking. But it's more than the craft. It has heart.The cinematography was exceptional with shots from above of a vast waterway and close up views of the beach, inside a ship, and the French shoreline.A perfect machine of a movie. Nolan adapts all feelings associated with war into a technical masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish].</td></tr>\n",

Truth be told I disliked it on my first viewing...but there were elements I liked. Surely this couldn't be strike two for the new Star Wars trilogy? (I disliked 'The Force Awakens' also). Well this was my second viewing and I now feel I can get into this fully. Thing is, there is literally so much I could say about this movie it could possibly go on and on.

       "General Hux and the beginning: Twas this opening sequence that really bemused and worried me right away (as it did with many). Hux was a relatively solid slimy character introduced in the previous movie. All the trappings of a weaselly baddie. Alas here he has seemingly been reduced to an actual jokey comedic character that could so easily have been torn from the pages of a spoof. The first real dialog we get is an absolutely horrendous back and forth between Hux and Poe. Poe mocking Hux with his communications tomfoolery, or as we in reality call it, a lame mobile (cell) phone gag.\n",
       "\n",
       "Poe bravely tries to bring down a First Order (Empire) dreadnought during the first space battle. Unfortunately things aren't going too well and the Resistance (Rebels) are being slaughtered. The rebels have one last bomber and one chance to hit their target. In the nick of time the rebel pilot is able to drop the bombs, but how can bombs 'drop' when in space? What about TIE Bombers you say? Well I always thought TIE Bombers fired their bombs downward, like torpedoes essentially, but straight down. That's just me. Also, if you look closely the bomber hangar doors are already open when the pilot triggers the bombs. How was she not sucked out into space?\n",
       "\n",
       "Princess Leia: Oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We've all heard about this now but I can't just ignore it. Yes we know Leia has force abilities (as we saw in Bespin), and we know its entirely possible she has grown stronger with the force since then. That aside, its still almost impossible to get past how stupid this entire sequence looked and felt. To make matters even worse, when she flies/floats back to the ship, there was no airlock. The rebels simply open the flippin' door! Everyone would have been sucked out into space in a matter of seconds for flips sake. Oh and while we're at it, she suffered absolutely no injuries whilst getting blown out of the exploding ships bridge. No burns, cuts, broken bones, nothing. I'm not even sure how those TIE torpedoes got through the ships shields, I guess they were special torpedoes?\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there is of course the flip side to this stupid scene. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died in 2016 which naturally caused issues for the film. This scene was the perfect ending for Princess Leia under these circumstances. The fact that Fisher is no longer with us surely cemented that. But apparently not, apparently Johnson thought it better to bring her back and give the next director a real headache. The only thing I can think of is they have a large amount of pre-shot footage which they know they can flesh out into the next story. But if that's the case it sure as hell limits things drastically. Oh and they also killed Admiral Ackbar off-screen here too, you bastards!\n",

And 'the caretakers', dwarf sized toad-like creatures that appear to dress like century old nuns. Both races are completely unexplained and are completely useless to the plot. The Porgs merely serve as fluffy comedic relief, whilst the caretakers look like they belong in a 'Labyrinth' sequel.

Apart from milking large alien sea mammals for blue milk and generally being a grouch, there was also the lightsaber tossing moment. I'm not gonna dwell on it...but yes it was totally a 'fuck you' to the fanbase from director Rian Johnson. It was also a pathetic Disneyfied attempt at light humour.

A super rich casino city located on planet Cantonica, its packed with super rich alien lifeforms and humans (most of whom appeared to be white? Even all the city police were white men, interesting). Anyway this was the segment where Johnson (under orders of Disney I assume) added the core liberal commentary on our present day society. War profiteering, animal cruelty, slavery etc...its all here, all the juicy stuff. Unfortunately most average people don't wanna  see this kind of stuff crowbarred into a Star Wars movie, not so blatantly for no real reason anyway. At least try with some flippin' subtly.

I guess Kylo could have clouded his mind or whatever but wouldn't he detect that too? I dunno. Plus his personal guards seemed to be useless.

I'm fine with the ladies in here but Jesus talk about beyond obvious). Amazingly it turns out that Poe's plans were the wrong route after all and Holdo was in fact correct (another decent twist). The problem is, by the time this happens I was so against Holdo that it just didn't matter anymore. They made her so unlikeable that it was too late to turn that around.

       "Crait: Ah the Hoth battle bit. I guess it was too hard for Johnson and co not to copy the original trilogy. Seeing as before this we had a copy of the Emperor's throne room with Luke from 'Return of the Jedi' (Kylo, Rey and Snoke). And a copy of the asteroid sequence with the Falcon from 'Empire Strikes Back' (Falcon in the Crait caves). Anyway this time the Resistance have about 15 people left (although in the next shot we see dozens more soldiers outta nowhere), and they're up against an even bigger force from the First Order. Same layout as before, the Resistance base door behind a long trench with a few gun turrets. \n",
       "\n",
       "Salt!: Yes that's right, random Resistance fighter #5 luckily points out for us that the surface of Crait (or that area) is covered in salt. Just in case you mistook it for snow. You know, just in case you thought they were trying to copy the Hoth battle (insert eye roll here). Thing is, why did he do that? He could of killed himself, its an alien planet, you don't just stick random things in your mouth for Pete's sake. Is this the new Ridley Scott method of alien world exploration?\n",
       "\n",
       "The First Order use around 10 brand new AT-M6 walkers (with a few older AT-AT's for some reason), TIE's, Kylo's shuttle, and superlaser siege cannon. The Resistance use these old speeders (V-4X-D) which required a sort of rudder that stabilised them. I guess they must have been very old designs? The battle is indeed a fun highlight but is utterly stupid as the goodies should of been wiped out in minutes. In fact its so stupid I'm not even sure what they were attempting to do with those speeders. They certainly didn't have firepower to take on the walkers and they couldn't shoot at the TIE's. Its also here where Finn should of died in an emotional sacrificial moment of heroism...but he's saved by that idiot Rose which in turn gave the First Order the victory. Obviously Disney weren't ever gonna kill off their main minority actors, pish posh!\n",
       "\n",
       "Luke (again): So Luke dies...but why? It is shown Luke is using force projection to confront Kylo (a controversial aspect in itself). Are we to presume he was exhausted after using this power? So much so that he died? Maybe this ability is so powerful that it drains the users life force. Maybe that's why we've never seen it before? Maybe only the strongest most force sensitive Jedi can do it? Kinda makes you wonder why no one has ever used it before. Ben Kenobi could have used it against Vader when confronting him on the Death Star (if strong enough). Ditto Yoda against Count Dooku etc...Also have to ask why he projected himself looking younger, for Leia's sake?\n",
       "\n",
       "To sum up, looking closer this is really 'Empire Strikes Back', its just not as obvious. Rebels discovered, Rebels run away, Rebels pursued, Rebels lose in the end. What's funny is most of this movie is in fact a very slow chase between two very slow moving ships. And this is the first time we've heard about fuel issues in Star Wars also. A few other final little things. Phasma, what was the point? (and why don't all troopers wear her laser proof armour yet?). Nien Nunb's mask still doesn't look as good as the 83 version, how???!!! What the hell was all that crap with multiple Rey's in that hole? And what was that hole suppose to be? (other than another scene copied from EST. Luke in the cave on Dagobah). And the final sequence with that kid and his broom, kinda felt like another prequel-esque moment. Is this kid gonna be important?\n",
       "\n",
       "Did I like this new Star Wars movie? No, I liked bits, and when I say bits I mean bits. I liked the visuals, they were generally a massive improvement over 'The Force Awakens'. I genuinely loved the small chase sequence inside a huge Crait cave with TIE's hot on the Falcon's tail. Not only did this look great, it had some classic Chewie piloting moments plus some actual amusing interactions with the Porgs (dunno why Chewie would allow them to stay on the ship but whatever). The fact this sequence also had some John Williams classic Star Wars score along with it almost brought me to tears. I liked Snoke and his death (yup). Twas cool to see a big baddie go down so quickly and easily, unique. I also liked the First Order presence on Crait as it looked badass, alas nothing much happens with it. \n",
       "\n",
       "But overall I was again disappointed with the final product [b]although[/b] I will say I did enjoy it just that little more than 'The Force Awakens'. I'm really not so sure what they're gonna do going forward and the fact Abrams is back doesn't fill me with confidence.The first of the Star Wars franchise to saturate itself with that which everyone only talks about in the other outings: The Force. Duh. It's all anybody talks about, but hardly seen enough, used enough. But this one investigates just a little, eh? About time. And what about The Force? Does ability to access it's power guarantee happiness, for instance? Nooooooo, and the story follows those who can do so, and those poor souls who can't, making it the best Star Wars since ... The Empire Strikes Back. All this, and the set-up for what comes next. Well done indeed.Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens.  After a costly attack on the First Order, the Resistance is depleted of resources and retreats to a fortified moon base for a last stand; meanwhile Ray pleads with a reluctant Luke Skywalker to train her to be a Jedi.  None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc.  The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same.  In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones.  Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic.  And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs.  While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).It doesn't end with a space battle. It does begin with one though. And it does still come down to stopping a big laser from destroying what is positioned as the final stronghold of the resistance. This is The Last Jedi simplified, of course, but the point is, patterns. Stanzas. Everything in Star Wars, since the days of George Lucas, has worked in this recurring metrical unit where the past predicts the future and the future dictates the fate of our favorite characters. There is a great sense of scope and history in these films and with Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper) has utilized this rich history in a way that kind of upends those patterns. Those verses that were seemingly an inherent part of the Star Wars DNA. Typically, this would be something unexpected, but applauded as it would lead one to believe there are bold choices being made and new directions being taken and while this is true to a certain extent, what happens when you don't always like or agree with the choices being made or the direction being taken? With The Force Awakens J.J. Abrams created a revival for a new generation balancing the tasks of paying respects to the previous trilogy, setting-up new parts of the universe to be explored, and establishing a new generation of characters that fans could fall in love with. Key to this was Abrams backdrop of this great mythos and grandeur that only hinted at the darkness that had befallen the characters of the original trilogy since we'd last seen them. The Last Jedi would then seemingly follow through on the promise of this mythical status that had befallen Luke Skywalker and so there was much to be excited for going forward in the series. In fact, The Force Awakens put in place so much to build this aura of mystery and gravity that it was probably impossible for Johnson to deliver on all of them, but with the re-introduction of Mark Hamill's Skywalker here it is clear this is in fact, \"not going to go the way we (or at least I) thought,\" as Johnson immediately dispels this sense of mysticism in favor of a joke. A moment of deadpan humor that put me in a hesitant state of mind from which I don't know that I ever recovered. I've now seen the movie twice and I felt the same way both times. To be clear, I'm more than up for a movie that is self-aware to the point of not taking itself too seriously, but this almost broad comical direction and unwillingness to divulge that rich history or take advantage of it in the way The Force Awakens so gracefully set it up is nothing short of disappointing and may in fact be the most depressing aspect of what The Last Jedi seemingly promised and failed to deliver.\n",

I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour.Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight.A superb addition to the Skywalker Saga which is sure to leave fans with plenty to talk - and argue - about, Star Wars: The Last Jedi now stands proudly alongside The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time.The Last Jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series.It is much less vibrant, and thus stands out the flaws of a script that wants to cross certain limits.

       "\t Black Panther & 501105037 & 135 & Marvel Studios & Feb 16, 2018 & Ryan Coogler & This movie lived up to its hype. It's possibly one of the best films of its kind, and I especially liked the development of all the characters. The villain isn't just a villain. I understood him. Like all Marvel films, the visual and aural elements are excellent. Acting and writing are top notch here as well. This film is a bit more serious than most Marvel films, which works in its favor.t was about time we saw a Marvel superhero blockbuster starring mostly African-American actors and achieving the success and popularity that it did - and even better is how great it is, with a thrilling climax and relatable characters that compensate for a couple of flaws in the script.When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here.With a superb soundtrack and great performances from Michael B Jordan and Danai Gurira, this, for me, is the most enjoyable Marvel movie yet.  With none of the forced humour it shows stronger storytelling instead which keeps you gripped until the end. & \"Black Panther\" lived up to the hype.When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, \"Black Panther\" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender.Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times. And the final scene isn't the requisite pause before the next Marvel movie, but a genuine Moment. It's an emotionally rousing expression of why this movie matters, flaws and all.It's a powerful package.Black Panther is one of Marvel's best movies to date and Ryan Coogler has delivered something which is going to have a lasting impact not only on comic book fans but an entire generation. Wakanda Forever!Spectacular diversity magic! Black Panther slashes a lot of things, chiefly colonialism. In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him.\\\\\n",
       "\t Mad Max: Fury Road & 129483877 & 120 & Warner Bros. & May 15, 2015 & George Miller & 20/10/2017 - Crazy action masterpiece. Easily one of the greatest action films ever made. Right up there with Terminator 2!Mad Max is back in this Sequel/Reboot that blows the other Mad Max films out of the water, In a matter of fact it blows most action films out of the water too, This beautifully shot masterpiece has some of the best action scenes, Car chases and stunts that I've ever seen, It hardly slows down for nothing but when it does we do have an interesting but familiar plot that works very well, Tom Hardy was great fun as Max I wouldn't mind seeing him take up the role again, The effects and practical effects were all amazing, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but I'm betting the 3D would of been great, It's not often a film lives up to the hype but Fury Road is a film that all action fans should watch as it's a modern day classic in many ways.With lots of thrills and top notch action sequences Mad Max Fury road never fails to disappoint.George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run.                                                                               \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie.  This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support. & Happy end of the world.Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance.Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller's action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.Fury Road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee-led blockbusters which are built on CGI and designed to sell toys.Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off.I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around, when I'd adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle - not to mention the hilarious sexual politics.Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once.It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it.Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to \"dumb fun.\" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent.Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy.The sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking, and Miller's singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty.Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing, but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes.\\\\\n",
       "\t Wonder Woman & 412400625 & 141 & Warner Bros. Pictures & Jun 2, 2017 & Patty Jenkins & Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot.Before I start with my thoughts on this and everything surrounding, let me just say that, FINALLY, the DC Extended Universe gets one right with this movie.  You don't know how long I've been waiting to say those words.  Though, to be fair, after The Dark Knight Trilogy (THE best superhero trilogy bar none), I haven't kept up with any of DC's efforts to create its own massive universe.  I find Superman to be interminably boring, so I had no interest (outside of Michael Shannon) in seeing Man of Steel.  DC, in my opinion, made the wrong choice to keep Batman dark and brooding after The Dark Knight Trilogy so, again, I had no real interest in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice outside of maybe seeing Wonder Woman.  DC has done a poor job at building its own extended universe so, once again, I had no interest in the Justice League movie.  You see how it is.  Of the movies in this universe, the only one I've seen was Suicide Squad, which, while decent, wasn't good and squandered its potential.  Wonder Woman was the only shining beacon of hope in the horizon, the chance to (finally) do a female superhero movie right.  Elektra and Catwoman both sucked and Marvel, since their ascent, wasted their chance to be first in this race by not doing a Black Widow movie.  Here's the thing though, before I get to Wonder Woman, and I've mentioned this a lot, but DC Comics is essentially playing catch-up with Marvel.  That's why you see them bumbling and fumbling major movies, because they know they have to catch up, since Marvel has, pretty much had a monopoly on this superhero movie business since Iron Man came out in 2008.  The thing about Marvel is that they knew they couldn't rush things, they had to slowly plant the seeds for something bigger and, now, you see that that patience has paid off immensely.  I don't know how much money the MCU has raked in for Disney (and this is counting merchandising, DVD sales and other forms of revenue), but it has to be a multi-billion dollar franchise for Disney.  DC hasn't had the same patience, as they're following the same template without understanding why it worked in the first place.  It can't be all at once, it has to be done little by little.  Rome wasn't built in a day and DC has attempted to build Rome (with its extended universe) in 20 minutes.  But, at the same time, DC wasn't always a point of mockery.  DC characters were the first to make the transition from comic to successful major motion pictures with Superman (in 1978) and Batman (in 1989).  Marvel was playing catch-up to DC in the era following Batman's successful release.  They released some truly awful movies in the 90s, like Captain America in 1990 and The Fantastic Four in 94, which was so bad that it hasn't been released yet.  There may have been others, but those are the major ones that pop to mind.  So, in DC's defense, they can still make something of their universe.  But, and to me this is most important, the whole thing needs to not be so dark and serious.  Marvel has succeeded in large part because they know how to pace their movies.  They know that you need comedy in movies like this.  It can't be all darkness and brooding characters struggling with their own moral dilemmas about what is right and what is wrong.  The whole look of the films also needs some more life injected into them.  Marvel movies are diverse in settings and cinematography, so, in spite of being set in the same universe, the MCU films feel different tonally and visually.  In the DC, every movie sort of looks the same.  With a dark, grey and blue hue.  And, as great as this movie is, once they get to London, it's really more of the same in terms of visuals.  Having said all of that, let's move on shall we?  I'm honestly quite surprised that DC waited THIS long to make a Wonder Woman movie, particularly when, to me, this is the movie that should have started your whole extended universe.  This should have been the starting point for all things DCEU.  Firstly, if we're doing this in chronological order so, technically, this should have been first and, secondly, it's a great movie, so you start off with this and people would actually be pumped for the DCEU instead of looking at things so cynically now.  Because as things are now, Wonder Woman feels like the exception to the rule that DCEU movies aren't exactly good.  It's an asterisk.  And that's not to minimize this film's significance, because I do like the shift and I feel that DC knows that, at least for this moment in time, Wonder Woman is its most important character.  People have seen Superman and they've seen Batman and that's not to say that they're tired of the same shit, because there's still many fanboys/girls out there, but I think people want something that's new in that universe and Wonder Woman provides that for people.  So that's why, in my opinion, DC needs to worry far more about Wonder Woman, as she needs to be their top priority, for your cinematic universe going forward as opposed to the old, familiar faces.  Having said that, let's get going, shall we?  I think first I need to talk about Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman.  At first, honestly, I didn't get it.  Don't get me wrong, Gal Gadot is a very talented and attractive woman, but I just didn't get IT for the longest time.  But, having finally seen her as this character, I understand the decision to cast her in the role.  Firstly, for some reason or another, she's even more stunningly beautiful as Wonder Woman than even I imagined.  Plus, honestly, I find she brings all the values to the character that she needs.  So, in my opinion, it's a good combination of both.  Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) herself comes from a long line of Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus in order to protect mankind, really, from itself.  Ares, the god of war, being tots jelly of humanity, decided to plot its destruction by influencing them and his influence leading to the humans starting wars against each other.  Ares has also killed all of the gods with the exception of Zeus himself.  Zeus used the last of his power to wound Ares and making him retreat.  Long story short, Zeus essentially hid Themyscira (the island the Amazons live in) to keep from Ares from finding it and left them a weapon called the Godkiller for Ares' return.  Blah, blah, blah, long story short, Steve Trevor (an Allied spy) crashes his plane off the coast of Themyscira, wherein German soldiers follow him and there, they fight against the Amazonian women who, after losing some of their own, including Diana's aunt, defeat the German soldiers.  Steve, after telling them about the Great War (WWI) attempts to enlist the help of the Amazonian women in order to turn the tide of war, but Hippolyta (Diana's mother) has none of it.  Steve has found this notebook by this German doctor that tells of an attempt to create a deadlier form of mustard gas, which he's trying to put a stop to or else millions more will die.  Diana, being incredibly idealistic, figures that this is Ares' return to the world of men and she needs to put a stop to it by killing Ares.  Diana eventually does leave with Steve, she'll never be able to return to Themyscira again as a result.  So, eventually, Steve and Diana make their way to London, where they begin their plan to fight back against the Germans (pre-Hitler) and attempt to put a stop to this deadlier mustard gas.  I will say that the movie does miss a chance to tell an incredibly interesting story of Diana having to adjust to the gender differences once she makes it to London.  Women aren't allowed in the military, they're not even allowed in this war council to discuss an armistice between them and the Germans.  Diana, of course, finds her way in this meeting and she browbeats one of the generals for being a coward, acting as if the lives of his soldiers are less important than his own and not fighting alongside his men.  Women, at least in this point in time, have not been allowed the vote either.  And, honestly, it would have been incredibly interesting to explore that dynamic of Diana, coming from an island where women are clearly superior in every way (even though there's no men) to a place where women are so clearly oppressed.  There's a few hints of it here and there, but I think the movie would have benefited from exploring that dynamic a little bit more, in my opinion.  One of the things I liked about this movie is that, unlike a lot of superhero movies, I do think they try to give a face at the people that are being affected by the war and how that motivates Diana to try and help them, whether it's by driving the German soldiers from this small town or getting rid of Dr. Maru and Ludendorff, the ones not letting this armistice go through and who are also developing the deadlier mustard gas.  There's an interesting debate here that, honestly, I wish the movie would have stuck with.  There comes a point, much later in the film where Diana kills Ludendorff, as has been her goal all along, since she feels Ludendorff is Ares and killing him stops the fighting.  She does, in fact, kill Ludendorf, but the fighting does not stop.  In fact, you could argue, that it gets worse.  Diana questions Steve about why the fighting hasn't stopped and there's a discussion between the two where Steve says that, maybe, just maybe that's just how we are, we're (hard)wired to self-destruct.  There's just something to the idea that Diana believes that only one person is to blame for all of this and by stopping that one person stops the war itself.  It's an interesting idea because it brings to mind the questions that, really, maybe we're not really worth saving in some way, if all we do is keep killing each other every few years.  Not many superhero movies deal with this topic in this way.  But, of course, you could say that it's a bit of a red herring given that, in fact, Ludendorff was not Ares and, instead, was someone they considered an ally.  But it's interesting to explore regardless, given that Diana is still so naive about certain things in 'modern' times and how her idealistic values and ideas aren't shared by everyone around her.  I think that's probably one of the best thing this movie does, just sort of explore the idea that not everyone shares Diana's values and how, in a way, her views are sort either antiquated, ahead of their time or both.  Steve, who's been helpful to her every step of the way, does stand in her way in some scenes before, of course, Diana takes matter into her own hands.  Diana and Steve's relationship is also one of the strongest points of the movies.  This is in large part, of course, to how great Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are, their chemistry is excellent and, while the movie does contain a romantic angle between the two, it doesn't feel forced or unnatural.  As I mention, Gal Gadot's performance is very strong.  She's a badass, but she also brings heart and life to the character.  She's not necessarily a goody two-shoes like Captain America, but they share some similarities in how they view the world.  You can see how people would be drawn to her kind and compassionate nature and that's not something that, say, a lot of actors playing superheroes are able to capture.  The film does have a good bit of action and it is pretty damn good all things considered.  There were some parts that I felt were too Zak Snyder-y, like the whole slo-mo things that Zak Snyder abused in 300.  But, at the very least, in this case, it can be explained by the fact that one of Diana's superpowers is seeing bullets in slo-mo, which allows her to deflect them before they harm her or anybody.  So, at least, it's not a stylistic choice that was abused, it has actual significance.  The action gets a thumbs up from me as if that wasn't obvious.  So you know how I mentioned earlier that the movie touches on the fact that, maybe, humanity isn't worth saving if all we are is doomed to destroy ourselves.  Well, later on in the movie, Diana comes to the realization that, in spite of everything, humanity is worth fighting for.  One of the things I didn't like, there's actually a couple of minor issues I had, is the fact that the whole ending of Diana saying that she believes love will end up saving us is really kind of corny and cheesy.  Not that the message isn't a worthy one, it's just how it's handled.  And, really, Steve's ultimate act of sacrifice was one made for love, so it makes sense that Diana would believe that, it's execution is still a bit corny.  Another thing that bothered me is that, ultimately, the fighting DID stop after Diana killed Ares and, I don't know, I feel like that's too simplistic of a conclusion for something as complex as the first World War.  I like the earlier themes which, while certainly more bleak (and that's something DCEU could do to remove from its movies), it's still a better conclusion and, at the same time, Diana can still come to the same conclusion she did as a result of Steve's actions.  Minor issues, really, as it didn't really affect my overall enjoyment of the film.  Having said that, do I think that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made?  No, not really.  It's the best movie based on one of DC's properties since the Dark Knight Trilogy finished off in 2012.  It's a great superhero movie, with a strong origin story at its core, great performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and a more humanistic approach to its conflict, in that the people Diana and Steve are trying to save aren't entirely faceless as they usually are in these movies (even in the MCU).  But, at the same time, there's nothing really about this movie that extends the boundaries of what we know the superhero genre to be.  It works solely within that framework.  And there's nothing wrong with that but, to me, the best superhero movies transcend their framework to become something more, something fresh within this genre and, honestly, I don't think this offered anything fresh.  Maybe that's just me.  Regardless of all of that, this is still a great superhero movie and, as mentioned, this should have been DC's first step in their attempts to create their own cinematic universe.  As such, we cannot turn back time and, as I mentioned earlier, Wonder Woman should be DC's top priority right now.  Wonder Woman needs to be the centerpiece of their extended universe if they want to come close to rivaling Marvel.  Or even just being a strong number 2.  They're number 2 by default, but they're not a strong number 2.  With that said, this is a great start to this franchise and I'm eagerly looking forward to more from this character and how DC decides to expand the character.  I would easily recommend this.The fourth movie in the current DC extended universe that has been exploding onto our screens with much aplomb. Well actually no it hasn't but that was the idea wasn't it. So far things have been a bit dodgy to say the least, could this movie turn the tide? Well according to just about everyone this movie did seem to do just that. So has the movies popularity, hype and praise swayed me in any way? Is it justified? Or do we have yet another {[}i{]}Ghostbusters{[}/i{]} (2016) scenario? \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie is basically a prequel to the 2016 movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' whereby it shows the origins of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), whilst at the same time connecting to the events that occur within BvS. The fact its this way around is of course due to WB's lack of patience and coordination in their comicbook universe building (playing catch up with Marvel as fast as possible). The plot however pans out as you might expect, in the usual comicbook fashion. We learn about Diana's homeland, her culture and people. We learn about a pending almighty evil that threatens everything. Outsider shows up and ends up helping Diana in her quest to find and eliminate evil. A bit of exposition, some minor alternate bad guys to deal with, a few key battles and then one big CGI finale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Much like the recent 'Kong: Skull Island' (2017) I had an initial problem with the fictional Amazonian homeland of Themyscira. This place appears to be a very large group of islands plopped in the middle of an ocean somewhere. The problem being it appears to be hidden by a perpetual weather system and some kind of invisibility force field. Obviously this is a fantasy movie so something like this shouldn't really matter. But the entire notion that no one has ever stumbled across this rather large place, and reported it, just seems completely unbelievable. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that when German forces actually find this location (whilst chasing a downed Steve Trevor), they simply start to attack! Why would they do that?? Such an important discovery like that. Also what exactly happened to the German ship? Did the force field sink it?\n",
       "\n",
       "The story moves swiftly on as we follow Diana and Steve (Chris Pine) back to London (its 1918). The plan: Steve simply wants to hand back some important stolen information regarding Nazi gas weapon advancements (Steve was an undercover spy). Where as Diana wants to find the evil God Ares and kill him so she can stop WWI. Diana has basically been brainwashed all about Zeus and his dastardly son who wants to wipe out mankind (Zeus' creation) because he thinks they are a destructive race. She believes Ares is the cause of WWI and she can stop it. The thing this narrative becomes extremely annoying truth be told because Diana never shuts up about it. \n",
       "\n",
       "Diana is essentially very naive and genuinely curious about this new outside world. She clearly has no idea of gender, society rules and the fact that people might treat each other differently. She finds these human elements and more (such as not helping people in need or acting carelessly with other lives), completely reprehensible. She simply does not understand how people could act this way. The thing is, I found it quite grating after a time because Diana mentions it in almost every scene! I fully understood the need to show and express her emotions on these factors but Jesus, you can truly feel Steve's frustration as he tries to help and explain to her. Good acting? Sure, still annoying to listen to over and over though.\n",
       "\n",
       "This being a 2017 movie I also understand the requirements for diversity and whatnot. So when it came to Steve's little band of merry men, naturally they were gonna be a diverse bunch. I had no problem with this except for a few tiny details. Firstly, the crazy Scot, surely they could of cast someone other than Ewen Bremner, such predictable and safe casting. Then my other gripe was the native American character. No problem including the guy, but did they have native Americans in the trenches in WWI? Hey I could be wrong but this kinda felt like they were going for a bit {[}b{]}too{[}/b{]} much diversity there. Kinda reaching a bit methinks. Also would they really wear their native attire? In other words would Sameer from Morocco (I'm guessing) go around wearing a fez in a wartime situation? Would the Chief Napi go around dressed like a cowboy or hunter? Shouldn't they be wearing protective clothing? Yeah I'm being picky I know.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have to admit the Wonder Woman theme tune is very catchy and it does work well here. The action scenes are very well executed and look terrific, but when that score kicks in it does get your adrenaline fired up a bit that's for sure. The entire movie looks good in general but I put that down to the charming period setting of the early 1900's and WWI. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has noticed that movies shot during either world wars always seem to look very authentic and adventurous. Indeed this movie like others ('The Rocketeer', 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark/Last Crusade', 'Captain America: The First Avenger' etc...) looks authentic, adventurous and harrowing all at the same time. There is a fine balance between the horrors of war and a rollicking comicbook yarn, and its upheld nicely here. Dare I say a bit darker than the first Captain America movie.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think its safe to say the best sequence is where we get our first glimpse of Wonder Woman in battle. She disrobes in front of the stunned allied troops and simply strolls out into no man's land sword and shield at the ready. Other than that things tended to get a bit CGI obvious for me. In the first battle Diana is leaping around like a frog and merely throwing Germans all over the shop. I'm sure they would have been killed or badly injured but it felt like more of a cop out in the heat of the moment. I wanted to see her run troops through, slice n dice. The German soldiers also became obvious CGI ragdolls once launched.\n",
       "\n",
       "The finale was also a bit weak in my opinion. Firstly Diana kills off the main German baddie (Danny Huston) on a packed base, yet no one seemingly cares. Then she fights Ares who turns out to be the elderly David Thewlis! Now don't get me wrong, it was quite refreshing to see a villain not played by some roided up meathead. But watching Thewlis become this electrical power wielding super God was a tad silly. Twas also a bit silly seeing these two superheroes slug it out on one side of this military base; then on the other side mortals are fighting their puny war. Oh and Diana lets the evil Doctor poison go in the end too? Like wut??!! Is that female privilege?\n",
       "\n",
       "So was this as good as all the hype? Yes and no for me. Its certainly a solid superhero flick, its better than virtually all the DC offerings, and it gives some Marvel efforts a good run for their money too. The main problem for me is simple, superhero fatigue. There have been so many of these movies now, and most are generally the same spiel. Its really hard to watch a single superhero movie now and {[}b{]}not{[}/b{]} think I've seen it all before. But that's because I have, you could essentially swap out Wonder Woman here for any other superhero character, and it would still work the same. So yes its a good solid movie, but its nothing special, it does nothing overly original.The movie is at its best when it focuses on the quieter character moments and when it embraces the weirder elements of the comics (the prominent use of the \"Lasso of Truth\"  is wonderful) some of the action sequences are a little flat but that's to be expected. & As befitting the genre, Wonder Woman is heroic and spirited. The fighting sequences are spectacular, and the story is engrossing, uplifting and fun. There's even a bit of romance and humor amid all the action. {[}Full review in Japanese{]}\"Wonder Woman\" is a superhero movie, and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre, but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy.Beauty, strength, goodness, bravery: These are your values, and here is how your values must look.Jenkins tries not only to include men on Wonder Woman's side but also to make male viewers feel better about a woman saving them.The final big action sequence, as now seems always to be the case, is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones, even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions.Wonder Woman embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace in a mainstream delivery system. And the female lead is not solely a mother, sister, girlfriend or hooker, however gold her heart: wonder of wonders!Gadot - who I'm not yet convinced is a great actor - is one hundred percent perfect in this role, to the extent that it would be a much poorer movie without the zeal and charisma which she brings to the titular Princess of the Amazons.Not a great film, but it is a good one.Not only is Wonder Woman an action film for all ages and genders, but it has a great positive message: no matter how ugly the world gets because of war and dictators, we must be good, protect one another and do right by one other.The superhero film is dripping with engaging characters and you find yourself engrossed with the story. But the film takes a sharp detour in its second half to unveil something incredibly formulaic and predictable.A triumph and the first truly great DC Films release, Wonder Woman exceeds every expectation and stands tall as one of the greatest superhero movies of all-time.Its brain, sense of spectacle, its excellent visual and its approach to an icon of popular culture place it as one of the best superhero movies since 'The Dark Knight' of Christopher Nolan. {[}Full review in Spanish{]}\\\\\n",

       "                                Adrian Molina & Pixar...what else can you say? They can tell a story as well as anyone ever, and better than most. This is a moving film with lots to say about family and music. Of course I loved it. Of course I could tell where it was probably going. I didn't care. I laughed and cried. It reminded me of my mother-in-law Ruth at one point. I connected with it completely. Great movie.I'm starting this review a few hours before, I'm assuming, I watch tonight's featured film, so I may not finish this review in time given that I seem to wax poetic whenever I'm reviewing Pixar movies.  Look, I've mentioned this a lot when reviewing their movies, but it's obvious that since this Disney mandated sequelitis, with Pixar releasing four sequels starting in 2011 with Cars 2 whereas, prior to that, they had only released two sequels (Toy Story 2 and 3) in the preceding 15 years prior to that point.  I suppose you could make the argument that this heavy focus on sequels started with Toy Story 3, but I don't like to count that since, unlike the other sequels they've done since, it felt like a natural continuation of the story established in the previous films.  Toy Story 4, in my opinion, doesn't make sense because, to me, they've already finished that story and that narrative.  While I've no doubt that Toy Story 4 will deliver the goods, there's no real angle to justify a sequel, creatively at least, since, again, the toys got the send-off they deserved in the third flick.  That's neither here nor there, I suppose, but it's obvious that Disney has pushed them towards this route, given that sequels are easier sells than original films, with all the merchandising deals they can make.  I felt that Pixar even hinted at this with a character in Cars 3.  I'm not getting into that, since I already went over it in the review for that movie.  But, again, it's been a really long time since, to me, Pixar felt like Pixar.  As great as Inside Out and Finding Dory were, I felt like they were a step below Pixar's standards.  Inside Out had some repetitiveness and Finding Dory, well, it was great, but it just wasn't excellent.  Having said that, Inside Out was great and it showed that Pixar's true passion lies in creating new stories and exploring new horizons.  While I had my issues with Inside Out, it was a glimpse that Pixar still had it in them to create stories that really do hit home.  Particularly Inside Out since, essentially, it was a movie about mental illness, a very real topic.  And it explored that topic with all the intelligence and warmth we've come to expect from Pixar.  This brings us to Coco and, goddamnit, if this isn't the best movie Pixar has made in, honestly, almost a decade.  Toy Story 3 (a modern classic) was released 8 years ago and nothing of theirs, since then, has even come close to that.  Well, that is, until this little gem of a movie came along.  I suppose I should get this out of the way first, and it might be a controversial statement to some (particularly if you're a crackpot right-winger), but Mexican mythology/folklore is superior to its American equivalent in every way, shape or form.  I'm not talking about one country being superior to the other, that's not what I'm saying at all (though the U.S has one MAJOR, orange flaw in their midst).  What I'm saying is that stuff like this, that explores Dia de los Muertos and its significance in that culture is so rich and detailed and, really, there's nothing that can even rival that in the States.  There's nothing.  I'm willing to wait it out if you do have something that comes close to that or the decorative skulls and, again, its significance to that culture and the Dia de los Muertos.  There's a movie similar to this one, called The Book of Life and, really, the similarities are skin-deep, because while the movie definitely delves into the other side, where spirits of the dead go after they, you know, die, I think this movie goes into more detail regarding the day and the offerings people make in order to, quite literally, allow their loved ones to visit them and see how they are doing.  This is one of the more important aspects of the movie, since, if a person does not have a photo of them put up as part of an offering, they can't cross to the other side and see their living loved ones.  Another important thing to note is that the dead aren't in the 'other side' forever.  The moment the last person who remembers them is gone (as in dead) they fade away into who knows what.  This is important to the narrative.  Anyway, let's move on.  The movie looks at Miguel, a 12-year-old kid who wants to be a musician when he grows up.  There's just one caveat and that is that his great-great-grandmother banned music in their family when her husband, a musician, abandoned her with her daughter to pursue his dreams of becoming famous.  Miguel, disillusioned but not giving up, has a guitar stashed away in a secret room along with video tapes of his favorite singer/actor/everything awesome, Ernesto De La Cruz.  Long story short, Miguel finds a photo that leads him to believe that De La Cruz is a relative of his.  After an incident where Miguel's grandmother breaks his guitar for refusing to listen to her, he runs away to a mausoleum, where De La Cruz's coffin is at, complete with his signature guitar.  He takes the guitar, stealing from the dead on the Dia de los Muertos, is a big no-no, so he is sent to the other side.  This is where he meets his long-dead relatives (whose photos are on the offering table their family has set-up).  Basically, being sent back to the land of the living, Miguel just has to get a blessing from one of his relatives.  His great-grandmother does so on the condition that he give up music.  Miguel reluctantly agrees, but proceeds to take the guitar and is, again, sent back to the land of the dead.  This is where the movie picks up, with Miguel going on a journey to find De La Cruz in order to get HIS blessing, since he approves of Miguel pursuing his career.  Miguel teams up with a trickster named Hector, who apparently knows De La Cruz.  Hector helps Miguel on the condition that, when Miguel comes back to the land of the living, he put up Hector's picture on the offering table, so he can come back to the land of the living and see his daughter one last time.  The thing about the movie and its narrative is that it is very easy to figure out what the 'twist' is gonna be.  And, you know what, I felt like that didn't actually hamper my enjoyment of the movie at all.  In fact, in some ways, I felt that it added to my enjoyment.  Exploring the theme of death in a film like this, one that's aimed at a family audience, is definitely very tricky.  Obviously you have to do it in a way that teaches you something about who we are as human beings and how we treat our dead.  Also, it's intriguing because, again, movies like this just try to shy away from that theme, but not this flick.  I guess it's because, death, is an inherent part of Mexican culture.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, in the slightest, it's just that, if you're a believer, then death really isn't the end.  Regardless of whether or not you can interact with your deceased loved ones, you can, according to the offerings, allow them a glimpse into your life to show them that, still, you have them in your hearts and your thoughts.  And, really, as much as I'm not a superstitious man, I find that there's a lot of beauty in that.  Beauty that is explored thoroughly in this movie cause, in spite of it all, this is a story about family and the love of that family keeping the spirits of their deceased loved ones alive.  As far as the narrative goes, again, there's some predictability, but that doesn't detract from how emotionally engaging the movie really is.  Hector is a man that you sympathize with and, this might be very spoiler heavy (YOU'VE BEEN WARNED), his journey to see his daughter one last time is emotionally heart-wrenching.  Hector is a man, who was murdered by De La Cruz (who stole all his songs and became famous off of them), who just wants to see his daughter one last time.  Which is what he was about to do when he was poisoned by De La Cruz.  There's something he mentions, since it's teased that Hector is just about to fade away (given that his daughter is dying) and it's that the only chance he has to see his daughter and, the moment she dies, is the moment he fades away.  So he can't even see his daughter in the land of the dead and there's something, honestly, quite heartbreaking about that.  He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.  That's why you sympathize with him and root for him all the way until he finally gets his wish to be put up on an offering table to visit his family on the Dia de los Muertos.  The movie, obviously is steeped in Mexican culture and, while I'm not Mexican, you can see that these people really fucking did their research.  It's not an exploitation of that culture, it is a celebration of the culture and everything that encompasses it.  And I think that's the best thing about this movie, because there's a certain apprehension one feels when you hear that Pixar is tackling Mexican culture in one of their films.  You just feel that they might not get it right.  But, again, in my opinion, they did a wonderful job at exploring the culture, it doesn't poke fun at the superstitious nature of the people and, again, it just celebrates the beauty (really) in the Dia de los Muertos celebration.  Of course, and this should go without saying, that the animation is, literally, out of this world.  I can't even imagine how gorgeous this movie would look on a 4K television.  But it's not just the beauty and, again, this is something that I've mentioned a lot in my Pixar reviews, it's just the amount of detail they put into even the tiniest of things.  And, honestly, it's the sort of thing that you'd really have to watch the movie multiple times to catch on.  There's a reason these people are the best at what they do, because they've got some of the best animators working for them.  I honestly can't rave enough about them.  As I mentioned, the story goes to some very interesting places and it's a very engaging film from beginning to end.  Of course, the movie being the way it is, there's some very emotional moments.  But, again, it doesn't feel unearned.  The film's world is so well-constructed and the characters so well-developed that it doesn't feel manipulative in the slightest.  Miguel singing Hector's song that he wrote for his young daughter who's now, clearly, in her 90s and nearly dying is...oh god, the feels were too strong with that one.  But, again, in spite of that and those definitely very emotional moments, it all adds up to a lovely and beautiful result.  Death, in this universe and culture, is not seen as the bad thing that it is in the U.S.   It is just the next step and, as long as you keep their memory alive in your hearts, then they'll always be there.  That sounds very cliched, but it's a sentiment that this movie explores beautifully.  The voice acting is excellent, as it almost always is in these movies.  The kid who plays Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) is tremendous, Gael Garcia Bernal is tremendous.  To avoid repeating myself too much, everyone here is tremendous as far as voice acting is concerned.  I don't really know what else I can say about this movie.  I'm not saying this is one of Pixar's best because, considering their track record, it's not.  But it's also not far from that level either.  This is a fantastic movie and, really, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss out on this, particularly now that it's on Netflix.  Highly recommended and I loved absolutely every second of this.This may actually be PIxar's least funny film, but that's beside the point. It actually succeeds in everything it sets out to do: tell a beautifully animated and deeply touching story while paying respect to a fascinating Mexican tradition. The visuals are breath-taking and the story so sweet, you have to admire that the film somewhat holds back on the usual slapstick and sticks to its very humane message. Adorable and a feast for all senses!Coco is an extravagant tale of culture and ambition that's exemplary in all aspects: sights, sound and story. The film touts its vibrant layout, rhythmic vibes and overall heartfelt tone that hits home deeply and more uniquely in a fashion befitting of Disney \\& Pixar . 4.97/5 & At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar, after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995), is finally eating itself. At best, well, it's a superbly polished, technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?Funny, irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times.This is a charming and very memorable film.Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough.Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes.Of every Pixar film that deals with family, memory, and loss, ask, \"Is there sufficient reason for the tears that will inevitably run down my face by the end?\" Yes, thanks in no small part to the ingenious use of De La Cruz's hit song, \"Remember Me.\"It is gorgeous and stunning, but will also make sure that you will be ugly crying and calling your family members after the film credits start rolling.It is fun when this is the proposal, vibrant when it wants to be, and it hits us right in the heart when it decides it is time to make us cry. {[}Full Review in Spanish{]}It's not the best the studio has put out, but it's certainly the most emotionally wrought.

       "\t Dunkirk & 188042171 & 107 & Warner Bros. Pictures & Jul 21, 2017 & Christopher Nolan & From Christopher Nolan comes the World War II epic Dunkirk.  It doesn't really have a plot as such, but instead attempts to recreate a visceral experience as it following an anonymous soldier on the beach waiting for rescue, a pilot patrolling the sky, and a civilian boat captain making way for Dunkirk in response to the government's call for aid.  There isn't very much dialog, and what little there is is rather incidental and only reveals fragments of the Dunkirk battle/evacuation.  However, Nolan conveys so much through his use of the camera and the images, that little is needed.  The desperation and enormity of the situation comes through, and is quite powerful.  Despite its lack of narrative, Dunkirk is a compelling war film.Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.Christopher Nolan's latest offering is an accurate representation of an event that occurred in 1940 during WWII. British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. \n",
       "\n",
       "Situated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue. Up to 400 various manned craft were voluntarily used and braved the English Channel along with various military vessels. Despite the fact that German forces had halted their crushing advance on Dunkirk (giving the Allies some time to organise the evac), the Luftwaffe were still hitting the port and its beaches and enemy troops were still on the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nolan's film tells the story of Dunkirk from separate angles, land sea and air. The first angle is from a young British private called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who has survived a recent German ambush and has made his way to the beaches. We follow Tommy as he tries to get on-board a couple ships only for them to be sunk by German attacks. Tommy eventually ends up back on the beaches with some Scottish soldiers and a French soldier. The second angle is from RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and two other Spitfire pilots who are part of the British airborne resistance against the German bombers. And the third angle is from a Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son Peter and his sons best friend George. All of whom have volunteered to help in the rescue with the aid of Mr. Dawson's yacht.\n",
       "\n",
       "First off Nolan's film is not like most traditional films. There is very little dialog throughout the entire runtime; instead Nolan relies on pure visuals and the musical score to convey the films atmosphere. That is where the film may be problematic for many people, this isn't a war movie filled with blood, guts, gun battles and explosions. Obviously if you know about the actual historical event then you would know to expect this. The most dialog comes from the story surrounding Mr. Dawson and his son Peter, second to that would probably be Tommy's story, then lastly and most obviously is Farrier's story which is almost entirely conveyed through Tom Hardy's facial expressions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now whilst I did fully appreciate Nolan's vision here, I have to admit to finding it somewhat odd watching a movie like this with little dialog. Looking at Farrier's story (the air section), it was indeed very impressive to watch these old Spitfires dogfight with German Messerschmitt's. Naturally it wasn't shot in the typical Hollywood action sequence type way. What you get are highly realistic air sequences which show the planes trying to manoeuvre into position to be able to attack each other. When the attacks come they are short bursts with very little fanfare. When a plane gets hit nothing much happens at first. The pilots communications are brief and not filled with silly quips. Basically overall it kinda feels like you're watching some kind of airshow display or training video, the fact everything is shot in natural light kinda adds to that.\n",
       "\n",
       "The story surrounding Tommy is probably the most Hollywood-esque part of the movie, but it still may not please some. Once again this is a highly realistic vision, there are no 'Saving Private Ryan' sequences on this beach. The plot is straight forward, Tommy and another soldier try to board ships by using an injured soldier as their ticket essentially. That seems almost wrong but in the grand scheme of things who wouldn't do that? The fact that they try to get away twice and both times the ships are sunk did seem almost too unlucky to me. The fact that later on they reach another ship and yet again it gets sunk, kinda felt a bit overly dramatic perhaps. Did that many ships get sunk in the real event? \n",
       "\n",
       "Tommy's tale certainly has the most cinematic visuals of the film, the numerous shots of the troops lined up on the beach are incredibly haunting, yet beautiful. Its easily the most intriguing of the three main plots but at the same time its also a bit too 'Spielbergian' methinks. When Tommy meets up with the Scottish soldiers things get a tad by the numbers and a little dull. I also felt the death of the French soldier (who was thought to be a Brit) was again a little touch of Hollywood which maybe wasn't required. It was too predictable, the minute he is exposed as French you kinda knew his number was up. I should add that whilst all this is going on we get little snippets of Kenneth Branagh as a Commander overseeing the operation from the beach. Again like Hardy he tends to emote through facial expressions more than dialog. \n",
       "\n",
       "For me the weakest of the stories was following Mr. Dawson and his son. Call me shallow but this was simply because it wasn't really that interesting. I found myself yearning for the plot to get back to the beaches, or in the air with Farrier. Don't get me wrong, Mark Rylance puts in a great performance as the calm and steadfast Dawson, and its important to see the civilian angle of this story. The thing is it just wasn't really that intriguing watching this trio sale slowly towards Dunkirk.\n",
       "\n",
       "The subplot of them rescuing a stranded officer (Cillian Murphy) from a shipwreck was also something of an odd addition. Murphy's officer is shell-shocked, he argues about going to Dunkirk and tries to stop Dawson. This leads to George (Peter's best friend) falling and badly injuring his head...which leads to his eventual death! I really didn't see the point in all this because it goes nowhere. Dawson and Peter lie to the shell-shocked officer about it and that's kinda that. Neither Dawson or Peter came across as upset when the incident occurred or when George dies. You're left wondering what happens with that. Does the officer get done for murder upon return to England? Would he be let off because of the fact he was shell-shocked?\n",

       "Would I say this is one of the greatest war films ever made? In terms of realism yes. In terms of score, cinematography and craftsmanship yes. In terms of engagement (for me the viewer) I'd say its up there, but maybe not the best. I totally and utterly shower praise on Nolan and co for their vision and what they have achieved here, the authenticity being the number one factor of course (score not far behind). But I cannot deny the film is a little slow at times. I hate myself for saying this but I did find myself yearning for just a touch of romanticised heroism or emotion just to get those waterworks going. \n",

       "The final sequence showing Farrier taking out one last German bomber before he is forced to land in enemy territory from lack of fuel, was so fecking awesome. Seeing the Spitfire land in one shot on the Dunkirk beach was fantastic, as was seeing a stoic Farrier stare into the camera as he is captured and led away. But dagnabbit Chris, I just needed a hint, a mere drop of glossy sentimentality. The film was {[}b{]}so{[}/b{]} realistic that it didn't really feel like a film at times (again I hate myself for saying this). But bottom line, this film is a tour de force that ignores manufactured heroics and stereotypical Hollywood-isms.It's gripping, perilous and uniquely envisioned. Dunkirk blends the fine direction of Christopher Nolan and the captivating historical event to put you on the edge emotionally. 4.5/5 & Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.Few films have stripped war down to its terrifying, thrilling essence as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, and few films have turned war into such an overwhelming, almost physical experience.Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.It isn't a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing.\"Virtual reality without the headset\", {[}Nolan{]} calls it, and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen.Occasional bursts of flames, imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters, come as a relief from the chromatic tedium.Nolan has managed to make a masterpiece in a genre crowded with masterpieces, one that will likely be held up as one of the best ever about World War II.{[}Dunkirk{]} is massive and impressive.Nolan's knack for 'sculpting in time' reaches a new apex. Dunkirk is to Nolan as 'David' is to Michelangelo. It's his masterpiece.From the artful cinematography to Hans Zimmer's disorienting score, and the non-linear narrative to the dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk is a practice in the bursting through the boundaries of filmmaking. But it's more than the craft. It has heart.The cinematography was exceptional with shots from above of a vast waterway and close up views of the beach, inside a ship, and the French shoreline.A perfect machine of a movie. Nolan adapts all feelings associated with war into a technical masterpiece. {[}Full review in Spanish{]}.\\\\\n",
       "\t Star Wars: The Last Jedi & 619117636 & 152 & Walt Disney Pictures & Dec 15, 2017 & Rian Johnson & The first time I saw this movie I couldn't really review it properly, I needed more time, I needed to see it again. Truth be told I disliked it on my first viewing...but there were elements I liked. Surely this couldn't be strike two for the new Star Wars trilogy? (I disliked 'The Force Awakens' also). Well this was my second viewing and I now feel I can get into this fully. Thing is, there is literally so much I could say about this movie it could possibly go on and on. So this time I'm gonna go with a slightly new layout. I'm simply gonna list my thoughts in sections and try to keep them as tight as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "General Hux and the beginning: Twas this opening sequence that really bemused and worried me right away (as it did with many). Hux was a relatively solid slimy character introduced in the previous movie. All the trappings of a weaselly baddie. Alas here he has seemingly been reduced to an actual jokey comedic character that could so easily have been torn from the pages of a spoof. The first real dialog we get is an absolutely horrendous back and forth between Hux and Poe. Poe mocking Hux with his communications tomfoolery, or as we in reality call it, a lame mobile (cell) phone gag.\n",
       "\n",
       "Poe bravely tries to bring down a First Order (Empire) dreadnought during the first space battle. Unfortunately things aren't going too well and the Resistance (Rebels) are being slaughtered. The rebels have one last bomber and one chance to hit their target. In the nick of time the rebel pilot is able to drop the bombs, but how can bombs 'drop' when in space? What about TIE Bombers you say? Well I always thought TIE Bombers fired their bombs downward, like torpedoes essentially, but straight down. That's just me. Also, if you look closely the bomber hangar doors are already open when the pilot triggers the bombs. How was she not sucked out into space?\n",
       "\n",
       "Princess Leia: Oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We've all heard about this now but I can't just ignore it. Yes we know Leia has force abilities (as we saw in Bespin), and we know its entirely possible she has grown stronger with the force since then. That aside, its still almost impossible to get past how stupid this entire sequence looked and felt. To make matters even worse, when she flies/floats back to the ship, there was no airlock. The rebels simply open the flippin' door! Everyone would have been sucked out into space in a matter of seconds for flips sake. Oh and while we're at it, she suffered absolutely no injuries whilst getting blown out of the exploding ships bridge. No burns, cuts, broken bones, nothing. I'm not even sure how those TIE torpedoes got through the ships shields, I guess they were special torpedoes?\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there is of course the flip side to this stupid scene. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died in 2016 which naturally caused issues for the film. This scene was the perfect ending for Princess Leia under these circumstances. The fact that Fisher is no longer with us surely cemented that. But apparently not, apparently Johnson thought it better to bring her back and give the next director a real headache. The only thing I can think of is they have a large amount of pre-shot footage which they know they can flesh out into the next story. But if that's the case it sure as hell limits things drastically. Oh and they also killed Admiral Ackbar off-screen here too, you bastards!\n",
       "\n",
       "Anch-To and Luke: Adrift in a cold sea on an oceanic planet, this small windswept circular rocky island houses the first Jedi temple and the tree library of the sacred Jedi texts. The inhabitants of this small island? Small cutesy flightless (I think) bird-like creatures that get everywhere. And 'the caretakers', dwarf sized toad-like creatures that appear to dress like century old nuns. Both races are completely unexplained and are completely useless to the plot. The Porgs merely serve as fluffy comedic relief, whilst the caretakers look like they belong in a 'Labyrinth' sequel. The only creature we briefly see that grabbed my attention was the sea monster breaking the surface in the background.\n",
       "\n",
       "As with the Leia controversy I'm sure everyone now knows about the Luke controversy. Apart from milking large alien sea mammals for blue milk and generally being a grouch, there was also the lightsaber tossing moment. I'm not gonna dwell on it...but yes it was totally a 'fuck you' to the fanbase from director Rian Johnson. It was also a pathetic Disneyfied attempt at light humour. They basically used a powerful emotional moment in the plot for a quick laugh. Oh it was a plot twist you say? Keep em'.\n",
       "\n",
       "Canto Bight: Ugh! Sorry just raising my head outta my hands. Well I guess if anyone wanted something more akin to a Lucas movie this was it. Alas more akin to the worst of the Lucas prequels. Yep this entire subplot was completely unnecessary and really ugly looking. A super rich casino city located on planet Cantonica, its packed with super rich alien lifeforms and humans (most of whom appeared to be white? Even all the city police were white men, interesting). Anyway this was the segment where Johnson (under orders of Disney I assume) added the core liberal commentary on our present day society. War profiteering, animal cruelty, slavery etc...its all here, all the juicy stuff. Unfortunately most average people don't wanna  see this kind of stuff crowbarred into a Star Wars movie, not so blatantly for no real reason anyway. At least try with some flippin' subtly. It was really no surprise that this subplot surrounded the new character of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) who herself was the epitome of a token politically correct character.\n",
       "\n",
       "DJ (Benicio del Toro): Another very pointless character if you ask me. Stupid name, stupid way of talking. I suppose he's the Lando of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if he pops up again. Main question surrounding him, I wonder just who did that ship he pinched belong to. The owner of which was selling ships to both the Resistance and First Order. A possible set up for later on?\n",
       "\n",
       "Snoke: So he dies, yeah that went nowhere or so we think. I didn't mind that he died (a decent twist for me) but the way it happened seemed silly to me. This bloke is all powerful with the dark side but couldn't detect Kylo Ren moving a lightsaber that was inches from his person?? I guess Kylo could have clouded his mind or whatever but wouldn't he detect that too? I dunno. Plus his personal guards seemed to be useless. Rey showing her invincibility again...despite being revealed as a nobody. Oh and neither Rey nor Kylo actually use any force powers in that fight, eh?\n",
       "\n",
       "Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern): In short, a very unlikeable character who looked like a middle aged woman having a midlife crisis (the purple hair). At first it literally seemed like she was just there to put the men (the flyboys) in their place with a show of Disney backed feminism (anyone else notice that both the Resistance and First Order seem to have had a major female recruitment campaigns? I'm fine with the ladies in here but Jesus talk about beyond obvious). Amazingly it turns out that Poe's plans were the wrong route after all and Holdo was in fact correct (another decent twist). The problem is, by the time this happens I was so against Holdo that it just didn't matter anymore. They made her so unlikeable that it was too late to turn that around. Oh and all this technology but a major ship doesn't have autopilot? Really?\n",
       "\n",
       "Yoda: Very cool (hehe) but why not Ben? Or Anakin? Or Qui-Gon? And force ghosts can now do stuff? They can make things happen in the realms of the living? And again another case of Johnson trying to throw out Star Wars lore and legend by having Yoda destroy the Jedi texts (although we see later they weren't...somehow).\n",
       "\n",
       "Crait: Ah the Hoth battle bit. I guess it was too hard for Johnson and co not to copy the original trilogy. Seeing as before this we had a copy of the Emperor's throne room with Luke from 'Return of the Jedi' (Kylo, Rey and Snoke). And a copy of the asteroid sequence with the Falcon from 'Empire Strikes Back' (Falcon in the Crait caves). Anyway this time the Resistance have about 15 people left (although in the next shot we see dozens more soldiers outta nowhere), and they're up against an even bigger force from the First Order. Same layout as before, the Resistance base door behind a long trench with a few gun turrets. \n",
       "\n",
       "Salt!: Yes that's right, random Resistance fighter \\#5 luckily points out for us that the surface of Crait (or that area) is covered in salt. Just in case you mistook it for snow. You know, just in case you thought they were trying to copy the Hoth battle (insert eye roll here). Thing is, why did he do that? He could of killed himself, its an alien planet, you don't just stick random things in your mouth for Pete's sake. Is this the new Ridley Scott method of alien world exploration?\n",
       "\n",
       "The First Order use around 10 brand new AT-M6 walkers (with a few older AT-AT's for some reason), TIE's, Kylo's shuttle, and superlaser siege cannon. The Resistance use these old speeders (V-4X-D) which required a sort of rudder that stabilised them. I guess they must have been very old designs? The battle is indeed a fun highlight but is utterly stupid as the goodies should of been wiped out in minutes. In fact its so stupid I'm not even sure what they were attempting to do with those speeders. They certainly didn't have firepower to take on the walkers and they couldn't shoot at the TIE's. Its also here where Finn should of died in an emotional sacrificial moment of heroism...but he's saved by that idiot Rose which in turn gave the First Order the victory. Obviously Disney weren't ever gonna kill off their main minority actors, pish posh!\n",
       "\n",
       "Luke (again): So Luke dies...but why? It is shown Luke is using force projection to confront Kylo (a controversial aspect in itself). Are we to presume he was exhausted after using this power? So much so that he died? Maybe this ability is so powerful that it drains the users life force. Maybe that's why we've never seen it before? Maybe only the strongest most force sensitive Jedi can do it? Kinda makes you wonder why no one has ever used it before. Ben Kenobi could have used it against Vader when confronting him on the Death Star (if strong enough). Ditto Yoda against Count Dooku etc...Also have to ask why he projected himself looking younger, for Leia's sake?\n",
       "\n",
       "To sum up, looking closer this is really 'Empire Strikes Back', its just not as obvious. Rebels discovered, Rebels run away, Rebels pursued, Rebels lose in the end. What's funny is most of this movie is in fact a very slow chase between two very slow moving ships. And this is the first time we've heard about fuel issues in Star Wars also. A few other final little things. Phasma, what was the point? (and why don't all troopers wear her laser proof armour yet?). Nien Nunb's mask still doesn't look as good as the 83 version, how???!!! What the hell was all that crap with multiple Rey's in that hole? And what was that hole suppose to be? (other than another scene copied from EST. Luke in the cave on Dagobah). And the final sequence with that kid and his broom, kinda felt like another prequel-esque moment. Is this kid gonna be important?\n",
       "\n",
       "Did I like this new Star Wars movie? No, I liked bits, and when I say bits I mean bits. I liked the visuals, they were generally a massive improvement over 'The Force Awakens'. I genuinely loved the small chase sequence inside a huge Crait cave with TIE's hot on the Falcon's tail. Not only did this look great, it had some classic Chewie piloting moments plus some actual amusing interactions with the Porgs (dunno why Chewie would allow them to stay on the ship but whatever). The fact this sequence also had some John Williams classic Star Wars score along with it almost brought me to tears. I liked Snoke and his death (yup). Twas cool to see a big baddie go down so quickly and easily, unique. I also liked the First Order presence on Crait as it looked badass, alas nothing much happens with it. \n",
       "\n",
       "But overall I was again disappointed with the final product {[}b{]}although{[}/b{]} I will say I did enjoy it just that little more than 'The Force Awakens'. I'm really not so sure what they're gonna do going forward and the fact Abrams is back doesn't fill me with confidence.The first of the Star Wars franchise to saturate itself with that which everyone only talks about in the other outings: The Force. Duh. It's all anybody talks about, but hardly seen enough, used enough. But this one investigates just a little, eh? About time. And what about The Force? Does ability to access it's power guarantee happiness, for instance? Nooooooo, and the story follows those who can do so, and those poor souls who can't, making it the best Star Wars since ... The Empire Strikes Back. All this, and the set-up for what comes next. Well done indeed.Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens.  After a costly attack on the First Order, the Resistance is depleted of resources and retreats to a fortified moon base for a last stand; meanwhile Ray pleads with a reluctant Luke Skywalker to train her to be a Jedi.  None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc.  The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same.  In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones.  Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic.  And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs.  While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).It doesn't end with a space battle. It does begin with one though. And it does still come down to stopping a big laser from destroying what is positioned as the final stronghold of the resistance. This is The Last Jedi simplified, of course, but the point is, patterns. Stanzas. Everything in Star Wars, since the days of George Lucas, has worked in this recurring metrical unit where the past predicts the future and the future dictates the fate of our favorite characters. There is a great sense of scope and history in these films and with Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper) has utilized this rich history in a way that kind of upends those patterns. Those verses that were seemingly an inherent part of the Star Wars DNA. Typically, this would be something unexpected, but applauded as it would lead one to believe there are bold choices being made and new directions being taken and while this is true to a certain extent, what happens when you don't always like or agree with the choices being made or the direction being taken? With The Force Awakens J.J. Abrams created a revival for a new generation balancing the tasks of paying respects to the previous trilogy, setting-up new parts of the universe to be explored, and establishing a new generation of characters that fans could fall in love with. Key to this was Abrams backdrop of this great mythos and grandeur that only hinted at the darkness that had befallen the characters of the original trilogy since we'd last seen them. The Last Jedi would then seemingly follow through on the promise of this mythical status that had befallen Luke Skywalker and so there was much to be excited for going forward in the series. In fact, The Force Awakens put in place so much to build this aura of mystery and gravity that it was probably impossible for Johnson to deliver on all of them, but with the re-introduction of Mark Hamill's Skywalker here it is clear this is in fact, \"not going to go the way we (or at least I) thought,\" as Johnson immediately dispels this sense of mysticism in favor of a joke. A moment of deadpan humor that put me in a hesitant state of mind from which I don't know that I ever recovered. I've now seen the movie twice and I felt the same way both times. To be clear, I'm more than up for a movie that is self-aware to the point of not taking itself too seriously, but this almost broad comical direction and unwillingness to divulge that rich history or take advantage of it in the way The Force Awakens so gracefully set it up is nothing short of disappointing and may in fact be the most depressing aspect of what The Last Jedi seemingly promised and failed to deliver.\n",

       "read the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com & \"Star Wars\" is not \"Breaking Bad,\" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former.What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student, grappling with his failure in this new role, and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher.While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality, the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year...Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us, it's a tolerably good time.The devoted will no doubt be delighted; for the rest, a resigned acceptance may be the safest path to enjoyment.In a world bursting with flashy popcorn movies, there's still nothing quite like a \"Star Wars\" flick.I loved The Last Jedi. I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour.Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight.A superb addition to the Skywalker Saga which is sure to leave fans with plenty to talk - and argue - about, Star Wars: The Last Jedi now stands proudly alongside The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time.The Last Jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series.It is much less vibrant, and thus stands out the flaws of a script that wants to cross certain limits. {[}Full Review in Spanish{]}The performances are very interesting, thanks to a cast that may not be the most iconic, but it's one of the most competent of the franchise. {[}Full Review in Spanish{]}\\\\\n",

       "| Black Panther | 501105037 | 135 | Marvel Studios | Feb 16, 2018 | Ryan Coogler | This movie lived up to its hype. It's possibly one of the best films of its kind, and I especially liked the development of all the characters. The villain isn't just a villain. I understood him. Like all Marvel films, the visual and aural elements are excellent. Acting and writing are top notch here as well. This film is a bit more serious than most Marvel films, which works in its favor.t was about time we saw a Marvel superhero blockbuster starring mostly African-American actors and achieving the success and popularity that it did - and even better is how great it is, with a thrilling climax and relatable characters that compensate for a couple of flaws in the script.When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here.With a superb soundtrack and great performances from Michael B Jordan and Danai Gurira, this, for me, is the most enjoyable Marvel movie yet.  With none of the forced humour it shows stronger storytelling instead which keeps you gripped until the end. | \"Black Panther\" lived up to the hype.When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, \"Black Panther\" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender.Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times. And the final scene isn't the requisite pause before the next Marvel movie, but a genuine Moment. It's an emotionally rousing expression of why this movie matters, flaws and all.It's a powerful package.Black Panther is one of Marvel's best movies to date and Ryan Coogler has delivered something which is going to have a lasting impact not only on comic book fans but an entire generation. Wakanda Forever!Spectacular diversity magic! Black Panther slashes a lot of things, chiefly colonialism. In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him. |\n",
       "| Mad Max: Fury Road | 129483877 | 120 | Warner Bros. | May 15, 2015 | George Miller | 20/10/2017 - Crazy action masterpiece. Easily one of the greatest action films ever made. Right up there with Terminator 2!Mad Max is back in this Sequel/Reboot that blows the other Mad Max films out of the water, In a matter of fact it blows most action films out of the water too, This beautifully shot masterpiece has some of the best action scenes, Car chases and stunts that I've ever seen, It hardly slows down for nothing but when it does we do have an interesting but familiar plot that works very well, Tom Hardy was great fun as Max I wouldn't mind seeing him take up the role again, The effects and practical effects were all amazing, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but I'm betting the 3D would of been great, It's not often a film lives up to the hype but Fury Road is a film that all action fans should watch as it's a modern day classic in many ways.With lots of thrills and top notch action sequences Mad Max Fury road never fails to disappoint.George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run.                                                                               \n",

You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support. | Happy end of the world.Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance.Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller's action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.Fury Road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee-led blockbusters which are built on CGI and designed to sell toys.Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off.I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around, when I'd adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle - not to mention the hilarious sexual politics.Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once.It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it.Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to \"dumb fun.\" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent.Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy.The sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking, and Miller's singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty.Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing, but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes. |\n",
       "| Wonder Woman | 412400625 | 141 | Warner Bros. Pictures | Jun 2, 2017 | Patty Jenkins | Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot.Before I start with my thoughts on this and everything surrounding, let me just say that, FINALLY, the DC Extended Universe gets one right with this movie.  You don't know how long I've been waiting to say those words.  Though, to be fair, after The Dark Knight Trilogy (THE best superhero trilogy bar none), I haven't kept up with any of DC's efforts to create its own massive universe.  I find Superman to be interminably boring, so I had no interest (outside of Michael Shannon) in seeing Man of Steel.  DC, in my opinion, made the wrong choice to keep Batman dark and brooding after The Dark Knight Trilogy so, again, I had no real interest in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice outside of maybe seeing Wonder Woman.  DC has done a poor job at building its own extended universe so, once again, I had no interest in the Justice League movie.  You see how it is.  Of the movies in this universe, the only one I've seen was Suicide Squad, which, while decent, wasn't good and squandered its potential.  Wonder Woman was the only shining beacon of hope in the horizon, the chance to (finally) do a female superhero movie right.  Elektra and Catwoman both sucked and Marvel, since their ascent, wasted their chance to be first in this race by not doing a Black Widow movie.  Here's the thing though, before I get to Wonder Woman, and I've mentioned this a lot, but DC Comics is essentially playing catch-up with Marvel.  That's why you see them bumbling and fumbling major movies, because they know they have to catch up, since Marvel has, pretty much had a monopoly on this superhero movie business since Iron Man came out in 2008.  The thing about Marvel is that they knew they couldn't rush things, they had to slowly plant the seeds for something bigger and, now, you see that that patience has paid off immensely.  I don't know how much money the MCU has raked in for Disney (and this is counting merchandising, DVD sales and other forms of revenue), but it has to be a multi-billion dollar franchise for Disney.  DC hasn't had the same patience, as they're following the same template without understanding why it worked in the first place.  It can't be all at once, it has to be done little by little.  Rome wasn't built in a day and DC has attempted to build Rome (with its extended universe) in 20 minutes.  But, at the same time, DC wasn't always a point of mockery.  DC characters were the first to make the transition from comic to successful major motion pictures with Superman (in 1978) and Batman (in 1989).  Marvel was playing catch-up to DC in the era following Batman's successful release.  They released some truly awful movies in the 90s, like Captain America in 1990 and The Fantastic Four in 94, which was so bad that it hasn't been released yet.  There may have been others, but those are the major ones that pop to mind.  So, in DC's defense, they can still make something of their universe.  But, and to me this is most important, the whole thing needs to not be so dark and serious.  Marvel has succeeded in large part because they know how to pace their movies.  They know that you need comedy in movies like this.  It can't be all darkness and brooding characters struggling with their own moral dilemmas about what is right and what is wrong.  The whole look of the films also needs some more life injected into them.  Marvel movies are diverse in settings and cinematography, so, in spite of being set in the same universe, the MCU films feel different tonally and visually.  In the DC, every movie sort of looks the same.  With a dark, grey and blue hue.  And, as great as this movie is, once they get to London, it's really more of the same in terms of visuals.  Having said all of that, let's move on shall we?  I'm honestly quite surprised that DC waited THIS long to make a Wonder Woman movie, particularly when, to me, this is the movie that should have started your whole extended universe.  This should have been the starting point for all things DCEU.  Firstly, if we're doing this in chronological order so, technically, this should have been first and, secondly, it's a great movie, so you start off with this and people would actually be pumped for the DCEU instead of looking at things so cynically now.  Because as things are now, Wonder Woman feels like the exception to the rule that DCEU movies aren't exactly good.  It's an asterisk.  And that's not to minimize this film's significance, because I do like the shift and I feel that DC knows that, at least for this moment in time, Wonder Woman is its most important character.  People have seen Superman and they've seen Batman and that's not to say that they're tired of the same shit, because there's still many fanboys/girls out there, but I think people want something that's new in that universe and Wonder Woman provides that for people.  So that's why, in my opinion, DC needs to worry far more about Wonder Woman, as she needs to be their top priority, for your cinematic universe going forward as opposed to the old, familiar faces.  Having said that, let's get going, shall we?  I think first I need to talk about Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman.  At first, honestly, I didn't get it.  Don't get me wrong, Gal Gadot is a very talented and attractive woman, but I just didn't get IT for the longest time.  But, having finally seen her as this character, I understand the decision to cast her in the role.  Firstly, for some reason or another, she's even more stunningly beautiful as Wonder Woman than even I imagined.  Plus, honestly, I find she brings all the values to the character that she needs.  So, in my opinion, it's a good combination of both.  Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) herself comes from a long line of Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus in order to protect mankind, really, from itself.  Ares, the god of war, being tots jelly of humanity, decided to plot its destruction by influencing them and his influence leading to the humans starting wars against each other.  Ares has also killed all of the gods with the exception of Zeus himself.  Zeus used the last of his power to wound Ares and making him retreat.  Long story short, Zeus essentially hid Themyscira (the island the Amazons live in) to keep from Ares from finding it and left them a weapon called the Godkiller for Ares' return.  Blah, blah, blah, long story short, Steve Trevor (an Allied spy) crashes his plane off the coast of Themyscira, wherein German soldiers follow him and there, they fight against the Amazonian women who, after losing some of their own, including Diana's aunt, defeat the German soldiers.  Steve, after telling them about the Great War (WWI) attempts to enlist the help of the Amazonian women in order to turn the tide of war, but Hippolyta (Diana's mother) has none of it.  Steve has found this notebook by this German doctor that tells of an attempt to create a deadlier form of mustard gas, which he's trying to put a stop to or else millions more will die.  Diana, being incredibly idealistic, figures that this is Ares' return to the world of men and she needs to put a stop to it by killing Ares.  Diana eventually does leave with Steve, she'll never be able to return to Themyscira again as a result.  So, eventually, Steve and Diana make their way to London, where they begin their plan to fight back against the Germans (pre-Hitler) and attempt to put a stop to this deadlier mustard gas.  I will say that the movie does miss a chance to tell an incredibly interesting story of Diana having to adjust to the gender differences once she makes it to London.  Women aren't allowed in the military, they're not even allowed in this war council to discuss an armistice between them and the Germans.  Diana, of course, finds her way in this meeting and she browbeats one of the generals for being a coward, acting as if the lives of his soldiers are less important than his own and not fighting alongside his men.  Women, at least in this point in time, have not been allowed the vote either.  And, honestly, it would have been incredibly interesting to explore that dynamic of Diana, coming from an island where women are clearly superior in every way (even though there's no men) to a place where women are so clearly oppressed.  There's a few hints of it here and there, but I think the movie would have benefited from exploring that dynamic a little bit more, in my opinion.  One of the things I liked about this movie is that, unlike a lot of superhero movies, I do think they try to give a face at the people that are being affected by the war and how that motivates Diana to try and help them, whether it's by driving the German soldiers from this small town or getting rid of Dr. Maru and Ludendorff, the ones not letting this armistice go through and who are also developing the deadlier mustard gas.  There's an interesting debate here that, honestly, I wish the movie would have stuck with.  There comes a point, much later in the film where Diana kills Ludendorff, as has been her goal all along, since she feels Ludendorff is Ares and killing him stops the fighting.  She does, in fact, kill Ludendorf, but the fighting does not stop.  In fact, you could argue, that it gets worse.  Diana questions Steve about why the fighting hasn't stopped and there's a discussion between the two where Steve says that, maybe, just maybe that's just how we are, we're (hard)wired to self-destruct.  There's just something to the idea that Diana believes that only one person is to blame for all of this and by stopping that one person stops the war itself.  It's an interesting idea because it brings to mind the questions that, really, maybe we're not really worth saving in some way, if all we do is keep killing each other every few years.  Not many superhero movies deal with this topic in this way.  But, of course, you could say that it's a bit of a red herring given that, in fact, Ludendorff was not Ares and, instead, was someone they considered an ally.  But it's interesting to explore regardless, given that Diana is still so naive about certain things in 'modern' times and how her idealistic values and ideas aren't shared by everyone around her.  I think that's probably one of the best thing this movie does, just sort of explore the idea that not everyone shares Diana's values and how, in a way, her views are sort either antiquated, ahead of their time or both.  Steve, who's been helpful to her every step of the way, does stand in her way in some scenes before, of course, Diana takes matter into her own hands.  Diana and Steve's relationship is also one of the strongest points of the movies.  This is in large part, of course, to how great Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are, their chemistry is excellent and, while the movie does contain a romantic angle between the two, it doesn't feel forced or unnatural.  As I mention, Gal Gadot's performance is very strong.  She's a badass, but she also brings heart and life to the character.  She's not necessarily a goody two-shoes like Captain America, but they share some similarities in how they view the world.  You can see how people would be drawn to her kind and compassionate nature and that's not something that, say, a lot of actors playing superheroes are able to capture.  The film does have a good bit of action and it is pretty damn good all things considered.  There were some parts that I felt were too Zak Snyder-y, like the whole slo-mo things that Zak Snyder abused in 300.  But, at the very least, in this case, it can be explained by the fact that one of Diana's superpowers is seeing bullets in slo-mo, which allows her to deflect them before they harm her or anybody.  So, at least, it's not a stylistic choice that was abused, it has actual significance.  The action gets a thumbs up from me as if that wasn't obvious.  So you know how I mentioned earlier that the movie touches on the fact that, maybe, humanity isn't worth saving if all we are is doomed to destroy ourselves.  Well, later on in the movie, Diana comes to the realization that, in spite of everything, humanity is worth fighting for.  One of the things I didn't like, there's actually a couple of minor issues I had, is the fact that the whole ending of Diana saying that she believes love will end up saving us is really kind of corny and cheesy.  Not that the message isn't a worthy one, it's just how it's handled.  And, really, Steve's ultimate act of sacrifice was one made for love, so it makes sense that Diana would believe that, it's execution is still a bit corny.  Another thing that bothered me is that, ultimately, the fighting DID stop after Diana killed Ares and, I don't know, I feel like that's too simplistic of a conclusion for something as complex as the first World War.  I like the earlier themes which, while certainly more bleak (and that's something DCEU could do to remove from its movies), it's still a better conclusion and, at the same time, Diana can still come to the same conclusion she did as a result of Steve's actions.  Minor issues, really, as it didn't really affect my overall enjoyment of the film.  Having said that, do I think that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made?  No, not really.  It's the best movie based on one of DC's properties since the Dark Knight Trilogy finished off in 2012.  It's a great superhero movie, with a strong origin story at its core, great performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and a more humanistic approach to its conflict, in that the people Diana and Steve are trying to save aren't entirely faceless as they usually are in these movies (even in the MCU).  But, at the same time, there's nothing really about this movie that extends the boundaries of what we know the superhero genre to be.  It works solely within that framework.  And there's nothing wrong with that but, to me, the best superhero movies transcend their framework to become something more, something fresh within this genre and, honestly, I don't think this offered anything fresh.  Maybe that's just me.  Regardless of all of that, this is still a great superhero movie and, as mentioned, this should have been DC's first step in their attempts to create their own cinematic universe.  As such, we cannot turn back time and, as I mentioned earlier, Wonder Woman should be DC's top priority right now.  Wonder Woman needs to be the centerpiece of their extended universe if they want to come close to rivaling Marvel.  Or even just being a strong number 2.  They're number 2 by default, but they're not a strong number 2.  With that said, this is a great start to this franchise and I'm eagerly looking forward to more from this character and how DC decides to expand the character.  I would easily recommend this.The fourth movie in the current DC extended universe that has been exploding onto our screens with much aplomb. Well actually no it hasn't but that was the idea wasn't it. So far things have been a bit dodgy to say the least, could this movie turn the tide? Well according to just about everyone this movie did seem to do just that. So has the movies popularity, hype and praise swayed me in any way? Is it justified? Or do we have yet another [i]Ghostbusters[/i] (2016) scenario? \n",
       "\n",
       "The movie is basically a prequel to the 2016 movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' whereby it shows the origins of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), whilst at the same time connecting to the events that occur within BvS. The fact its this way around is of course due to WB's lack of patience and coordination in their comicbook universe building (playing catch up with Marvel as fast as possible). The plot however pans out as you might expect, in the usual comicbook fashion. We learn about Diana's homeland, her culture and people. We learn about a pending almighty evil that threatens everything. Outsider shows up and ends up helping Diana in her quest to find and eliminate evil. A bit of exposition, some minor alternate bad guys to deal with, a few key battles and then one big CGI finale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Much like the recent 'Kong: Skull Island' (2017) I had an initial problem with the fictional Amazonian homeland of Themyscira. This place appears to be a very large group of islands plopped in the middle of an ocean somewhere. The problem being it appears to be hidden by a perpetual weather system and some kind of invisibility force field. Obviously this is a fantasy movie so something like this shouldn't really matter. But the entire notion that no one has ever stumbled across this rather large place, and reported it, just seems completely unbelievable. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that when German forces actually find this location (whilst chasing a downed Steve Trevor), they simply start to attack! Why would they do that?? Such an important discovery like that. Also what exactly happened to the German ship? Did the force field sink it?\n",
       "\n",
       "The story moves swiftly on as we follow Diana and Steve (Chris Pine) back to London (its 1918). The plan: Steve simply wants to hand back some important stolen information regarding Nazi gas weapon advancements (Steve was an undercover spy). Where as Diana wants to find the evil God Ares and kill him so she can stop WWI. Diana has basically been brainwashed all about Zeus and his dastardly son who wants to wipe out mankind (Zeus' creation) because he thinks they are a destructive race. She believes Ares is the cause of WWI and she can stop it. The thing this narrative becomes extremely annoying truth be told because Diana never shuts up about it. \n",
       "\n",
       "Diana is essentially very naive and genuinely curious about this new outside world. She clearly has no idea of gender, society rules and the fact that people might treat each other differently. She finds these human elements and more (such as not helping people in need or acting carelessly with other lives), completely reprehensible. She simply does not understand how people could act this way. The thing is, I found it quite grating after a time because Diana mentions it in almost every scene! I fully understood the need to show and express her emotions on these factors but Jesus, you can truly feel Steve's frustration as he tries to help and explain to her. Good acting? Sure, still annoying to listen to over and over though.\n",
       "\n",
       "This being a 2017 movie I also understand the requirements for diversity and whatnot. So when it came to Steve's little band of merry men, naturally they were gonna be a diverse bunch. I had no problem with this except for a few tiny details. Firstly, the crazy Scot, surely they could of cast someone other than Ewen Bremner, such predictable and safe casting. Then my other gripe was the native American character. No problem including the guy, but did they have native Americans in the trenches in WWI? Hey I could be wrong but this kinda felt like they were going for a bit [b]too[/b] much diversity there. Kinda reaching a bit methinks. Also would they really wear their native attire? In other words would Sameer from Morocco (I'm guessing) go around wearing a fez in a wartime situation? Would the Chief Napi go around dressed like a cowboy or hunter? Shouldn't they be wearing protective clothing? Yeah I'm being picky I know.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have to admit the Wonder Woman theme tune is very catchy and it does work well here. The action scenes are very well executed and look terrific, but when that score kicks in it does get your adrenaline fired up a bit that's for sure. The entire movie looks good in general but I put that down to the charming period setting of the early 1900's and WWI. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has noticed that movies shot during either world wars always seem to look very authentic and adventurous. Indeed this movie like others ('The Rocketeer', 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark/Last Crusade', 'Captain America: The First Avenger' etc...) looks authentic, adventurous and harrowing all at the same time. There is a fine balance between the horrors of war and a rollicking comicbook yarn, and its upheld nicely here. Dare I say a bit darker than the first Captain America movie.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think its safe to say the best sequence is where we get our first glimpse of Wonder Woman in battle. She disrobes in front of the stunned allied troops and simply strolls out into no man's land sword and shield at the ready. Other than that things tended to get a bit CGI obvious for me. In the first battle Diana is leaping around like a frog and merely throwing Germans all over the shop. I'm sure they would have been killed or badly injured but it felt like more of a cop out in the heat of the moment. I wanted to see her run troops through, slice n dice. The German soldiers also became obvious CGI ragdolls once launched.\n",
       "\n",
       "The finale was also a bit weak in my opinion. Firstly Diana kills off the main German baddie (Danny Huston) on a packed base, yet no one seemingly cares. Then she fights Ares who turns out to be the elderly David Thewlis! Now don't get me wrong, it was quite refreshing to see a villain not played by some roided up meathead. But watching Thewlis become this electrical power wielding super God was a tad silly. Twas also a bit silly seeing these two superheroes slug it out on one side of this military base; then on the other side mortals are fighting their puny war. Oh and Diana lets the evil Doctor poison go in the end too? Like wut??!! Is that female privilege?\n",
       "\n",
       "So was this as good as all the hype? Yes and no for me. Its certainly a solid superhero flick, its better than virtually all the DC offerings, and it gives some Marvel efforts a good run for their money too. The main problem for me is simple, superhero fatigue. There have been so many of these movies now, and most are generally the same spiel. Its really hard to watch a single superhero movie now and [b]not[/b] think I've seen it all before. But that's because I have, you could essentially swap out Wonder Woman here for any other superhero character, and it would still work the same. So yes its a good solid movie, but its nothing special, it does nothing overly original.The movie is at its best when it focuses on the quieter character moments and when it embraces the weirder elements of the comics (the prominent use of the \"Lasso of Truth\"  is wonderful) some of the action sequences are a little flat but that's to be expected. | As befitting the genre, Wonder Woman is heroic and spirited. The fighting sequences are spectacular, and the story is engrossing, uplifting and fun. There's even a bit of romance and humor amid all the action. [Full review in Japanese]\"Wonder Woman\" is a superhero movie, and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre, but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy.Beauty, strength, goodness, bravery: These are your values, and here is how your values must look.Jenkins tries not only to include men on Wonder Woman's side but also to make male viewers feel better about a woman saving them.The final big action sequence, as now seems always to be the case, is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones, even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions.Wonder Woman embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace in a mainstream delivery system. And the female lead is not solely a mother, sister, girlfriend or hooker, however gold her heart: wonder of wonders!Gadot - who I'm not yet convinced is a great actor - is one hundred percent perfect in this role, to the extent that it would be a much poorer movie without the zeal and charisma which she brings to the titular Princess of the Amazons.Not a great film, but it is a good one.Not only is Wonder Woman an action film for all ages and genders, but it has a great positive message: no matter how ugly the world gets because of war and dictators, we must be good, protect one another and do right by one other.The superhero film is dripping with engaging characters and you find yourself engrossed with the story. But the film takes a sharp detour in its second half to unveil something incredibly formulaic and predictable.A triumph and the first truly great DC Films release, Wonder Woman exceeds every expectation and stands tall as one of the greatest superhero movies of all-time.Its brain, sense of spectacle, its excellent visual and its approach to an icon of popular culture place it as one of the best superhero movies since 'The Dark Knight' of Christopher Nolan.

       "                                Adrian Molina | Pixar...what else can you say? They can tell a story as well as anyone ever, and better than most. This is a moving film with lots to say about family and music. Of course I loved it. Of course I could tell where it was probably going. I didn't care. I laughed and cried. It reminded me of my mother-in-law Ruth at one point. I connected with it completely. Great movie.I'm starting this review a few hours before, I'm assuming, I watch tonight's featured film, so I may not finish this review in time given that I seem to wax poetic whenever I'm reviewing Pixar movies.  Look, I've mentioned this a lot when reviewing their movies, but it's obvious that since this Disney mandated sequelitis, with Pixar releasing four sequels starting in 2011 with Cars 2 whereas, prior to that, they had only released two sequels (Toy Story 2 and 3) in the preceding 15 years prior to that point.  I suppose you could make the argument that this heavy focus on sequels started with Toy Story 3, but I don't like to count that since, unlike the other sequels they've done since, it felt like a natural continuation of the story established in the previous films.  Toy Story 4, in my opinion, doesn't make sense because, to me, they've already finished that story and that narrative.  While I've no doubt that Toy Story 4 will deliver the goods, there's no real angle to justify a sequel, creatively at least, since, again, the toys got the send-off they deserved in the third flick.  That's neither here nor there, I suppose, but it's obvious that Disney has pushed them towards this route, given that sequels are easier sells than original films, with all the merchandising deals they can make.  I felt that Pixar even hinted at this with a character in Cars 3.  I'm not getting into that, since I already went over it in the review for that movie.  But, again, it's been a really long time since, to me, Pixar felt like Pixar.  As great as Inside Out and Finding Dory were, I felt like they were a step below Pixar's standards.  Inside Out had some repetitiveness and Finding Dory, well, it was great, but it just wasn't excellent.  Having said that, Inside Out was great and it showed that Pixar's true passion lies in creating new stories and exploring new horizons.  While I had my issues with Inside Out, it was a glimpse that Pixar still had it in them to create stories that really do hit home.  Particularly Inside Out since, essentially, it was a movie about mental illness, a very real topic.  And it explored that topic with all the intelligence and warmth we've come to expect from Pixar.  This brings us to Coco and, goddamnit, if this isn't the best movie Pixar has made in, honestly, almost a decade.  Toy Story 3 (a modern classic) was released 8 years ago and nothing of theirs, since then, has even come close to that.  Well, that is, until this little gem of a movie came along.  I suppose I should get this out of the way first, and it might be a controversial statement to some (particularly if you're a crackpot right-winger), but Mexican mythology/folklore is superior to its American equivalent in every way, shape or form.  I'm not talking about one country being superior to the other, that's not what I'm saying at all (though the U.S has one MAJOR, orange flaw in their midst).  What I'm saying is that stuff like this, that explores Dia de los Muertos and its significance in that culture is so rich and detailed and, really, there's nothing that can even rival that in the States.  There's nothing.  I'm willing to wait it out if you do have something that comes close to that or the decorative skulls and, again, its significance to that culture and the Dia de los Muertos.  There's a movie similar to this one, called The Book of Life and, really, the similarities are skin-deep, because while the movie definitely delves into the other side, where spirits of the dead go after they, you know, die, I think this movie goes into more detail regarding the day and the offerings people make in order to, quite literally, allow their loved ones to visit them and see how they are doing.  This is one of the more important aspects of the movie, since, if a person does not have a photo of them put up as part of an offering, they can't cross to the other side and see their living loved ones.  Another important thing to note is that the dead aren't in the 'other side' forever.  The moment the last person who remembers them is gone (as in dead) they fade away into who knows what.  This is important to the narrative.  Anyway, let's move on.  The movie looks at Miguel, a 12-year-old kid who wants to be a musician when he grows up.  There's just one caveat and that is that his great-great-grandmother banned music in their family when her husband, a musician, abandoned her with her daughter to pursue his dreams of becoming famous.  Miguel, disillusioned but not giving up, has a guitar stashed away in a secret room along with video tapes of his favorite singer/actor/everything awesome, Ernesto De La Cruz.  Long story short, Miguel finds a photo that leads him to believe that De La Cruz is a relative of his.  After an incident where Miguel's grandmother breaks his guitar for refusing to listen to her, he runs away to a mausoleum, where De La Cruz's coffin is at, complete with his signature guitar.  He takes the guitar, stealing from the dead on the Dia de los Muertos, is a big no-no, so he is sent to the other side.  This is where he meets his long-dead relatives (whose photos are on the offering table their family has set-up).  Basically, being sent back to the land of the living, Miguel just has to get a blessing from one of his relatives.  His great-grandmother does so on the condition that he give up music.  Miguel reluctantly agrees, but proceeds to take the guitar and is, again, sent back to the land of the dead.  This is where the movie picks up, with Miguel going on a journey to find De La Cruz in order to get HIS blessing, since he approves of Miguel pursuing his career.  Miguel teams up with a trickster named Hector, who apparently knows De La Cruz.  Hector helps Miguel on the condition that, when Miguel comes back to the land of the living, he put up Hector's picture on the offering table, so he can come back to the land of the living and see his daughter one last time.  The thing about the movie and its narrative is that it is very easy to figure out what the 'twist' is gonna be.  And, you know what, I felt like that didn't actually hamper my enjoyment of the movie at all.  In fact, in some ways, I felt that it added to my enjoyment.  Exploring the theme of death in a film like this, one that's aimed at a family audience, is definitely very tricky.  Obviously you have to do it in a way that teaches you something about who we are as human beings and how we treat our dead.  Also, it's intriguing because, again, movies like this just try to shy away from that theme, but not this flick.  I guess it's because, death, is an inherent part of Mexican culture.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, in the slightest, it's just that, if you're a believer, then death really isn't the end.  Regardless of whether or not you can interact with your deceased loved ones, you can, according to the offerings, allow them a glimpse into your life to show them that, still, you have them in your hearts and your thoughts.  And, really, as much as I'm not a superstitious man, I find that there's a lot of beauty in that.  Beauty that is explored thoroughly in this movie cause, in spite of it all, this is a story about family and the love of that family keeping the spirits of their deceased loved ones alive.  As far as the narrative goes, again, there's some predictability, but that doesn't detract from how emotionally engaging the movie really is.  Hector is a man that you sympathize with and, this might be very spoiler heavy (YOU'VE BEEN WARNED), his journey to see his daughter one last time is emotionally heart-wrenching.  Hector is a man, who was murdered by De La Cruz (who stole all his songs and became famous off of them), who just wants to see his daughter one last time.  Which is what he was about to do when he was poisoned by De La Cruz.  There's something he mentions, since it's teased that Hector is just about to fade away (given that his daughter is dying) and it's that the only chance he has to see his daughter and, the moment she dies, is the moment he fades away.  So he can't even see his daughter in the land of the dead and there's something, honestly, quite heartbreaking about that.  He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.  That's why you sympathize with him and root for him all the way until he finally gets his wish to be put up on an offering table to visit his family on the Dia de los Muertos.  The movie, obviously is steeped in Mexican culture and, while I'm not Mexican, you can see that these people really fucking did their research.  It's not an exploitation of that culture, it is a celebration of the culture and everything that encompasses it.  And I think that's the best thing about this movie, because there's a certain apprehension one feels when you hear that Pixar is tackling Mexican culture in one of their films.  You just feel that they might not get it right.  But, again, in my opinion, they did a wonderful job at exploring the culture, it doesn't poke fun at the superstitious nature of the people and, again, it just celebrates the beauty (really) in the Dia de los Muertos celebration.  Of course, and this should go without saying, that the animation is, literally, out of this world.  I can't even imagine how gorgeous this movie would look on a 4K television.  But it's not just the beauty and, again, this is something that I've mentioned a lot in my Pixar reviews, it's just the amount of detail they put into even the tiniest of things.  And, honestly, it's the sort of thing that you'd really have to watch the movie multiple times to catch on.  There's a reason these people are the best at what they do, because they've got some of the best animators working for them.  I honestly can't rave enough about them.  As I mentioned, the story goes to some very interesting places and it's a very engaging film from beginning to end.  Of course, the movie being the way it is, there's some very emotional moments.  But, again, it doesn't feel unearned.  The film's world is so well-constructed and the characters so well-developed that it doesn't feel manipulative in the slightest.  Miguel singing Hector's song that he wrote for his young daughter who's now, clearly, in her 90s and nearly dying is...oh god, the feels were too strong with that one.  But, again, in spite of that and those definitely very emotional moments, it all adds up to a lovely and beautiful result.  Death, in this universe and culture, is not seen as the bad thing that it is in the U.S.   It is just the next step and, as long as you keep their memory alive in your hearts, then they'll always be there.  That sounds very cliched, but it's a sentiment that this movie explores beautifully.  The voice acting is excellent, as it almost always is in these movies.  The kid who plays Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) is tremendous, Gael Garcia Bernal is tremendous.  To avoid repeating myself too much, everyone here is tremendous as far as voice acting is concerned.  I don't really know what else I can say about this movie.  I'm not saying this is one of Pixar's best because, considering their track record, it's not.  But it's also not far from that level either.  This is a fantastic movie and, really, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss out on this, particularly now that it's on Netflix.  Highly recommended and I loved absolutely every second of this.This may actually be PIxar's least funny film, but that's beside the point. It actually succeeds in everything it sets out to do: tell a beautifully animated and deeply touching story while paying respect to a fascinating Mexican tradition. The visuals are breath-taking and the story so sweet, you have to admire that the film somewhat holds back on the usual slapstick and sticks to its very humane message. Adorable and a feast for all senses!Coco is an extravagant tale of culture and ambition that's exemplary in all aspects: sights, sound and story. The film touts its vibrant layout, rhythmic vibes and overall heartfelt tone that hits home deeply and more uniquely in a fashion befitting of Disney &amp; Pixar . 4.97/5 | At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar, after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995), is finally eating itself. At best, well, it's a superbly polished, technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?Funny, irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times.This is a charming and very memorable film.Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough.Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes.Of every Pixar film that deals with family, memory, and loss, ask, \"Is there sufficient reason for the tears that will inevitably run down my face by the end?\" Yes, thanks in no small part to the ingenious use of De La Cruz's hit song, \"Remember Me.\"It is gorgeous and stunning, but will also make sure that you will be ugly crying and calling your family members after the film credits start rolling.It is fun when this is the proposal, vibrant when it wants to be, and it hits us right in the heart when it decides it is time to make us cry. [Full Review in Spanish]It's not the best the studio has put out, but it's certainly the most emotionally wrought. It's almost hard to believe this is a movie for children.A fun, tender and bright adventure that, at the rhythm of 'Ranchera', excites and invites you to hold your tears as only the best films do. [Full Review in Spanish]Coco will tug at your heartstrings as it explores a culture often neglected, and a narrative that is incredibly important in the hopes of continuing the trend of cultural exploration ( ... ).The story's metaphysical slant lends the proceedings a haunting and ruminative air. |\n",
       "| Dunkirk | 188042171 | 107 | Warner Bros. Pictures | Jul 21, 2017 | Christopher Nolan | From Christopher Nolan comes the World War II epic Dunkirk.  It doesn't really have a plot as such, but instead attempts to recreate a visceral experience as it following an anonymous soldier on the beach waiting for rescue, a pilot patrolling the sky, and a civilian boat captain making way for Dunkirk in response to the government's call for aid.  There isn't very much dialog, and what little there is is rather incidental and only reveals fragments of the Dunkirk battle/evacuation.  However, Nolan conveys so much through his use of the camera and the images, that little is needed.  The desperation and enormity of the situation comes through, and is quite powerful.  Despite its lack of narrative, Dunkirk is a compelling war film.Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.Christopher Nolan's latest offering is an accurate representation of an event that occurred in 1940 during WWII. British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. \n",
       "\n",
       "Situated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue. Up to 400 various manned craft were voluntarily used and braved the English Channel along with various military vessels. Despite the fact that German forces had halted their crushing advance on Dunkirk (giving the Allies some time to organise the evac), the Luftwaffe were still hitting the port and its beaches and enemy troops were still on the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nolan's film tells the story of Dunkirk from separate angles, land sea and air. The first angle is from a young British private called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who has survived a recent German ambush and has made his way to the beaches. We follow Tommy as he tries to get on-board a couple ships only for them to be sunk by German attacks. Tommy eventually ends up back on the beaches with some Scottish soldiers and a French soldier. The second angle is from RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and two other Spitfire pilots who are part of the British airborne resistance against the German bombers. And the third angle is from a Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son Peter and his sons best friend George. All of whom have volunteered to help in the rescue with the aid of Mr. Dawson's yacht.\n",
       "\n",
       "First off Nolan's film is not like most traditional films. There is very little dialog throughout the entire runtime; instead Nolan relies on pure visuals and the musical score to convey the films atmosphere. That is where the film may be problematic for many people, this isn't a war movie filled with blood, guts, gun battles and explosions. Obviously if you know about the actual historical event then you would know to expect this. The most dialog comes from the story surrounding Mr. Dawson and his son Peter, second to that would probably be Tommy's story, then lastly and most obviously is Farrier's story which is almost entirely conveyed through Tom Hardy's facial expressions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now whilst I did fully appreciate Nolan's vision here, I have to admit to finding it somewhat odd watching a movie like this with little dialog. Looking at Farrier's story (the air section), it was indeed very impressive to watch these old Spitfires dogfight with German Messerschmitt's. Naturally it wasn't shot in the typical Hollywood action sequence type way. What you get are highly realistic air sequences which show the planes trying to manoeuvre into position to be able to attack each other. When the attacks come they are short bursts with very little fanfare. When a plane gets hit nothing much happens at first. The pilots communications are brief and not filled with silly quips. Basically overall it kinda feels like you're watching some kind of airshow display or training video, the fact everything is shot in natural light kinda adds to that.\n",
       "\n",
       "The story surrounding Tommy is probably the most Hollywood-esque part of the movie, but it still may not please some. Once again this is a highly realistic vision, there are no 'Saving Private Ryan' sequences on this beach. The plot is straight forward, Tommy and another soldier try to board ships by using an injured soldier as their ticket essentially. That seems almost wrong but in the grand scheme of things who wouldn't do that? The fact that they try to get away twice and both times the ships are sunk did seem almost too unlucky to me. The fact that later on they reach another ship and yet again it gets sunk, kinda felt a bit overly dramatic perhaps. Did that many ships get sunk in the real event? \n",
       "\n",
       "Tommy's tale certainly has the most cinematic visuals of the film, the numerous shots of the troops lined up on the beach are incredibly haunting, yet beautiful. Its easily the most intriguing of the three main plots but at the same time its also a bit too 'Spielbergian' methinks. When Tommy meets up with the Scottish soldiers things get a tad by the numbers and a little dull. I also felt the death of the French soldier (who was thought to be a Brit) was again a little touch of Hollywood which maybe wasn't required. It was too predictable, the minute he is exposed as French you kinda knew his number was up. I should add that whilst all this is going on we get little snippets of Kenneth Branagh as a Commander overseeing the operation from the beach. Again like Hardy he tends to emote through facial expressions more than dialog. \n",
       "\n",
       "For me the weakest of the stories was following Mr. Dawson and his son. Call me shallow but this was simply because it wasn't really that interesting. I found myself yearning for the plot to get back to the beaches, or in the air with Farrier. Don't get me wrong, Mark Rylance puts in a great performance as the calm and steadfast Dawson, and its important to see the civilian angle of this story. The thing is it just wasn't really that intriguing watching this trio sale slowly towards Dunkirk.\n",
       "\n",
       "The subplot of them rescuing a stranded officer (Cillian Murphy) from a shipwreck was also something of an odd addition. Murphy's officer is shell-shocked, he argues about going to Dunkirk and tries to stop Dawson. This leads to George (Peter's best friend) falling and badly injuring his head...which leads to his eventual death! I really didn't see the point in all this because it goes nowhere. Dawson and Peter lie to the shell-shocked officer about it and that's kinda that. Neither Dawson or Peter came across as upset when the incident occurred or when George dies. You're left wondering what happens with that. Does the officer get done for murder upon return to England? Would he be let off because of the fact he was shell-shocked?\n",
       "\n",
       "Would I say this is one of the greatest war films ever made? In terms of realism yes. In terms of score, cinematography and craftsmanship yes. In terms of engagement (for me the viewer) I'd say its up there, but maybe not the best. I totally and utterly shower praise on Nolan and co for their vision and what they have achieved here, the authenticity being the number one factor of course (score not far behind). But I cannot deny the film is a little slow at times. I hate myself for saying this but I did find myself yearning for just a touch of romanticised heroism or emotion just to get those waterworks going. \n",
       "\n",
       "The final sequence showing Farrier taking out one last German bomber before he is forced to land in enemy territory from lack of fuel, was so fecking awesome. Seeing the Spitfire land in one shot on the Dunkirk beach was fantastic, as was seeing a stoic Farrier stare into the camera as he is captured and led away. But dagnabbit Chris, I just needed a hint, a mere drop of glossy sentimentality. The film was [b]so[/b] realistic that it didn't really feel like a film at times (again I hate myself for saying this). But bottom line, this film is a tour de force that ignores manufactured heroics and stereotypical Hollywood-isms.It's gripping, perilous and uniquely envisioned. Dunkirk blends the fine direction of Christopher Nolan and the captivating historical event to put you on the edge emotionally. 4.5/5 | Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.Few films have stripped war down to its terrifying, thrilling essence as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, and few films have turned war into such an overwhelming, almost physical experience.Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.It isn't a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing.\"Virtual reality without the headset\", [Nolan] calls it, and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen.Occasional bursts of flames, imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters, come as a relief from the chromatic tedium.Nolan has managed to make a masterpiece in a genre crowded with masterpieces, one that will likely be held up as one of the best ever about World War II.[Dunkirk] is massive and impressive.Nolan's knack for 'sculpting in time' reaches a new apex. Dunkirk is to Nolan as 'David' is to Michelangelo. It's his masterpiece.From the artful cinematography to Hans Zimmer's disorienting score, and the non-linear narrative to the dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk is a practice in the bursting through the boundaries of filmmaking. But it's more than the craft. It has heart.The cinematography was exceptional with shots from above of a vast waterway and close up views of the beach, inside a ship, and the French shoreline.A perfect machine of a movie. Nolan adapts all feelings associated with war into a technical masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]. |\n",
       "| Star Wars: The Last Jedi | 619117636 | 152 | Walt Disney Pictures | Dec 15, 2017 | Rian Johnson | The first time I saw this movie I couldn't really review it properly, I needed more time, I needed to see it again. Truth be told I disliked it on my first viewing...but there were elements I liked. Surely this couldn't be strike two for the new Star Wars trilogy? (I disliked 'The Force Awakens' also). Well this was my second viewing and I now feel I can get into this fully. Thing is, there is literally so much I could say about this movie it could possibly go on and on. So this time I'm gonna go with a slightly new layout. I'm simply gonna list my thoughts in sections and try to keep them as tight as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "General Hux and the beginning: Twas this opening sequence that really bemused and worried me right away (as it did with many). Hux was a relatively solid slimy character introduced in the previous movie. All the trappings of a weaselly baddie. Alas here he has seemingly been reduced to an actual jokey comedic character that could so easily have been torn from the pages of a spoof. The first real dialog we get is an absolutely horrendous back and forth between Hux and Poe. Poe mocking Hux with his communications tomfoolery, or as we in reality call it, a lame mobile (cell) phone gag.\n",
       "\n",
       "Poe bravely tries to bring down a First Order (Empire) dreadnought during the first space battle. Unfortunately things aren't going too well and the Resistance (Rebels) are being slaughtered. The rebels have one last bomber and one chance to hit their target. In the nick of time the rebel pilot is able to drop the bombs, but how can bombs 'drop' when in space? What about TIE Bombers you say? Well I always thought TIE Bombers fired their bombs downward, like torpedoes essentially, but straight down. That's just me. Also, if you look closely the bomber hangar doors are already open when the pilot triggers the bombs. How was she not sucked out into space?\n",
       "\n",
       "Princess Leia: Oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We've all heard about this now but I can't just ignore it. Yes we know Leia has force abilities (as we saw in Bespin), and we know its entirely possible she has grown stronger with the force since then. That aside, its still almost impossible to get past how stupid this entire sequence looked and felt. To make matters even worse, when she flies/floats back to the ship, there was no airlock. The rebels simply open the flippin' door! Everyone would have been sucked out into space in a matter of seconds for flips sake. Oh and while we're at it, she suffered absolutely no injuries whilst getting blown out of the exploding ships bridge. No burns, cuts, broken bones, nothing. I'm not even sure how those TIE torpedoes got through the ships shields, I guess they were special torpedoes?\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there is of course the flip side to this stupid scene. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died in 2016 which naturally caused issues for the film. This scene was the perfect ending for Princess Leia under these circumstances. The fact that Fisher is no longer with us surely cemented that. But apparently not, apparently Johnson thought it better to bring her back and give the next director a real headache. The only thing I can think of is they have a large amount of pre-shot footage which they know they can flesh out into the next story. But if that's the case it sure as hell limits things drastically. Oh and they also killed Admiral Ackbar off-screen here too, you bastards!\n",
       "\n",
       "Anch-To and Luke: Adrift in a cold sea on an oceanic planet, this small windswept circular rocky island houses the first Jedi temple and the tree library of the sacred Jedi texts. The inhabitants of this small island? Small cutesy flightless (I think) bird-like creatures that get everywhere. And 'the caretakers', dwarf sized toad-like creatures that appear to dress like century old nuns. Both races are completely unexplained and are completely useless to the plot. The Porgs merely serve as fluffy comedic relief, whilst the caretakers look like they belong in a 'Labyrinth' sequel. The only creature we briefly see that grabbed my attention was the sea monster breaking the surface in the background.\n",
       "\n",
       "As with the Leia controversy I'm sure everyone now knows about the Luke controversy. Apart from milking large alien sea mammals for blue milk and generally being a grouch, there was also the lightsaber tossing moment. I'm not gonna dwell on it...but yes it was totally a 'fuck you' to the fanbase from director Rian Johnson. It was also a pathetic Disneyfied attempt at light humour. They basically used a powerful emotional moment in the plot for a quick laugh. Oh it was a plot twist you say? Keep em'.\n",
       "\n",
       "Canto Bight: Ugh! Sorry just raising my head outta my hands. Well I guess if anyone wanted something more akin to a Lucas movie this was it. Alas more akin to the worst of the Lucas prequels. Yep this entire subplot was completely unnecessary and really ugly looking. A super rich casino city located on planet Cantonica, its packed with super rich alien lifeforms and humans (most of whom appeared to be white? Even all the city police were white men, interesting). Anyway this was the segment where Johnson (under orders of Disney I assume) added the core liberal commentary on our present day society. War profiteering, animal cruelty, slavery etc...its all here, all the juicy stuff. Unfortunately most average people don't wanna  see this kind of stuff crowbarred into a Star Wars movie, not so blatantly for no real reason anyway. At least try with some flippin' subtly. It was really no surprise that this subplot surrounded the new character of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) who herself was the epitome of a token politically correct character.\n",
       "\n",
       "DJ (Benicio del Toro): Another very pointless character if you ask me. Stupid name, stupid way of talking. I suppose he's the Lando of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if he pops up again. Main question surrounding him, I wonder just who did that ship he pinched belong to. The owner of which was selling ships to both the Resistance and First Order. A possible set up for later on?\n",
       "\n",
       "Snoke: So he dies, yeah that went nowhere or so we think. I didn't mind that he died (a decent twist for me) but the way it happened seemed silly to me. This bloke is all powerful with the dark side but couldn't detect Kylo Ren moving a lightsaber that was inches from his person?? I guess Kylo could have clouded his mind or whatever but wouldn't he detect that too? I dunno. Plus his personal guards seemed to be useless. Rey showing her invincibility again...despite being revealed as a nobody. Oh and neither Rey nor Kylo actually use any force powers in that fight, eh?\n",
       "\n",
       "Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern): In short, a very unlikeable character who looked like a middle aged woman having a midlife crisis (the purple hair). At first it literally seemed like she was just there to put the men (the flyboys) in their place with a show of Disney backed feminism (anyone else notice that both the Resistance and First Order seem to have had a major female recruitment campaigns? I'm fine with the ladies in here but Jesus talk about beyond obvious). Amazingly it turns out that Poe's plans were the wrong route after all and Holdo was in fact correct (another decent twist). The problem is, by the time this happens I was so against Holdo that it just didn't matter anymore. They made her so unlikeable that it was too late to turn that around. Oh and all this technology but a major ship doesn't have autopilot? Really?\n",
       "\n",
       "Yoda: Very cool (hehe) but why not Ben? Or Anakin? Or Qui-Gon? And force ghosts can now do stuff? They can make things happen in the realms of the living? And again another case of Johnson trying to throw out Star Wars lore and legend by having Yoda destroy the Jedi texts (although we see later they weren't...somehow).\n",
       "\n",
       "Crait: Ah the Hoth battle bit. I guess it was too hard for Johnson and co not to copy the original trilogy. Seeing as before this we had a copy of the Emperor's throne room with Luke from 'Return of the Jedi' (Kylo, Rey and Snoke). And a copy of the asteroid sequence with the Falcon from 'Empire Strikes Back' (Falcon in the Crait caves). Anyway this time the Resistance have about 15 people left (although in the next shot we see dozens more soldiers outta nowhere), and they're up against an even bigger force from the First Order. Same layout as before, the Resistance base door behind a long trench with a few gun turrets. \n",
       "\n",
       "Salt!: Yes that's right, random Resistance fighter #5 luckily points out for us that the surface of Crait (or that area) is covered in salt. Just in case you mistook it for snow. You know, just in case you thought they were trying to copy the Hoth battle (insert eye roll here). Thing is, why did he do that? He could of killed himself, its an alien planet, you don't just stick random things in your mouth for Pete's sake. Is this the new Ridley Scott method of alien world exploration?\n",
       "\n",
       "The First Order use around 10 brand new AT-M6 walkers (with a few older AT-AT's for some reason), TIE's, Kylo's shuttle, and superlaser siege cannon. The Resistance use these old speeders (V-4X-D) which required a sort of rudder that stabilised them. I guess they must have been very old designs? The battle is indeed a fun highlight but is utterly stupid as the goodies should of been wiped out in minutes. In fact its so stupid I'm not even sure what they were attempting to do with those speeders. They certainly didn't have firepower to take on the walkers and they couldn't shoot at the TIE's. Its also here where Finn should of died in an emotional sacrificial moment of heroism...but he's saved by that idiot Rose which in turn gave the First Order the victory. Obviously Disney weren't ever gonna kill off their main minority actors, pish posh!\n",
       "\n",
       "Luke (again): So Luke dies...but why? It is shown Luke is using force projection to confront Kylo (a controversial aspect in itself). Are we to presume he was exhausted after using this power? So much so that he died? Maybe this ability is so powerful that it drains the users life force. Maybe that's why we've never seen it before? Maybe only the strongest most force sensitive Jedi can do it? Kinda makes you wonder why no one has ever used it before. Ben Kenobi could have used it against Vader when confronting him on the Death Star (if strong enough). Ditto Yoda against Count Dooku etc...Also have to ask why he projected himself looking younger, for Leia's sake?\n",
       "\n",
       "To sum up, looking closer this is really 'Empire Strikes Back', its just not as obvious. Rebels discovered, Rebels run away, Rebels pursued, Rebels lose in the end. What's funny is most of this movie is in fact a very slow chase between two very slow moving ships. And this is the first time we've heard about fuel issues in Star Wars also. A few other final little things. Phasma, what was the point? (and why don't all troopers wear her laser proof armour yet?). Nien Nunb's mask still doesn't look as good as the 83 version, how???!!! What the hell was all that crap with multiple Rey's in that hole? And what was that hole suppose to be? (other than another scene copied from EST. Luke in the cave on Dagobah). And the final sequence with that kid and his broom, kinda felt like another prequel-esque moment. Is this kid gonna be important?\n",
       "\n",
       "Did I like this new Star Wars movie? No, I liked bits, and when I say bits I mean bits. I liked the visuals, they were generally a massive improvement over 'The Force Awakens'. I genuinely loved the small chase sequence inside a huge Crait cave with TIE's hot on the Falcon's tail. Not only did this look great, it had some classic Chewie piloting moments plus some actual amusing interactions with the Porgs (dunno why Chewie would allow them to stay on the ship but whatever). The fact this sequence also had some John Williams classic Star Wars score along with it almost brought me to tears. I liked Snoke and his death (yup). Twas cool to see a big baddie go down so quickly and easily, unique. I also liked the First Order presence on Crait as it looked badass, alas nothing much happens with it. \n",
       "\n",
       "But overall I was again disappointed with the final product [b]although[/b] I will say I did enjoy it just that little more than 'The Force Awakens'. I'm really not so sure what they're gonna do going forward and the fact Abrams is back doesn't fill me with confidence.The first of the Star Wars franchise to saturate itself with that which everyone only talks about in the other outings: The Force. Duh. It's all anybody talks about, but hardly seen enough, used enough. But this one investigates just a little, eh? About time. And what about The Force? Does ability to access it's power guarantee happiness, for instance? Nooooooo, and the story follows those who can do so, and those poor souls who can't, making it the best Star Wars since ... The Empire Strikes Back. All this, and the set-up for what comes next. Well done indeed.Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens.  After a costly attack on the First Order, the Resistance is depleted of resources and retreats to a fortified moon base for a last stand; meanwhile Ray pleads with a reluctant Luke Skywalker to train her to be a Jedi.  None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc.  The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same.  In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones.  Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic.  And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs.  While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).It doesn't end with a space battle. It does begin with one though. And it does still come down to stopping a big laser from destroying what is positioned as the final stronghold of the resistance. This is The Last Jedi simplified, of course, but the point is, patterns. Stanzas. Everything in Star Wars, since the days of George Lucas, has worked in this recurring metrical unit where the past predicts the future and the future dictates the fate of our favorite characters. There is a great sense of scope and history in these films and with Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper) has utilized this rich history in a way that kind of upends those patterns. Those verses that were seemingly an inherent part of the Star Wars DNA. Typically, this would be something unexpected, but applauded as it would lead one to believe there are bold choices being made and new directions being taken and while this is true to a certain extent, what happens when you don't always like or agree with the choices being made or the direction being taken? With The Force Awakens J.J. Abrams created a revival for a new generation balancing the tasks of paying respects to the previous trilogy, setting-up new parts of the universe to be explored, and establishing a new generation of characters that fans could fall in love with. Key to this was Abrams backdrop of this great mythos and grandeur that only hinted at the darkness that had befallen the characters of the original trilogy since we'd last seen them. The Last Jedi would then seemingly follow through on the promise of this mythical status that had befallen Luke Skywalker and so there was much to be excited for going forward in the series. In fact, The Force Awakens put in place so much to build this aura of mystery and gravity that it was probably impossible for Johnson to deliver on all of them, but with the re-introduction of Mark Hamill's Skywalker here it is clear this is in fact, \"not going to go the way we (or at least I) thought,\" as Johnson immediately dispels this sense of mysticism in favor of a joke. A moment of deadpan humor that put me in a hesitant state of mind from which I don't know that I ever recovered. I've now seen the movie twice and I felt the same way both times. To be clear, I'm more than up for a movie that is self-aware to the point of not taking itself too seriously, but this almost broad comical direction and unwillingness to divulge that rich history or take advantage of it in the way The Force Awakens so gracefully set it up is nothing short of disappointing and may in fact be the most depressing aspect of what The Last Jedi seemingly promised and failed to deliver.\n",

       "read the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com | \"Star Wars\" is not \"Breaking Bad,\" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former.What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student, grappling with his failure in this new role, and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher.While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality, the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year...Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us, it's a tolerably good time.The devoted will no doubt be delighted; for the rest, a resigned acceptance may be the safest path to enjoyment.In a world bursting with flashy popcorn movies, there's still nothing quite like a \"Star Wars\" flick.I loved The Last Jedi. I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour.Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight.A superb addition to the Skywalker Saga which is sure to leave fans with plenty to talk - and argue - about, Star Wars: The Last Jedi now stands proudly alongside The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time.The Last Jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series.It is much less vibrant, and thus stands out the flaws of a script that wants to cross certain limits. [Full Review in Spanish]The performances are very interesting, thanks to a cast that may not be the most iconic, but it's one of the most competent of the franchise. [Full Review in Spanish] |\n",

       "1 This movie lived up to its hype. It's possibly one of the best films of its kind, and I especially liked the development of all the characters. The villain isn't just a villain. I understood him. Like all Marvel films, the visual and aural elements are excellent. Acting and writing are top notch here as well. This film is a bit more serious than most Marvel films, which works in its favor.t was about time we saw a Marvel superhero blockbuster starring mostly African-American actors and achieving the success and popularity that it did - and even better is how great it is, with a thrilling climax and relatable characters that compensate for a couple of flaws in the script.When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here.With a superb soundtrack and great performances from Michael B Jordan and Danai Gurira, this, for me, is the most enjoyable Marvel movie yet.  With none of the forced humour it shows stronger storytelling instead which keeps you gripped until the end.

       "2 20/10/2017 - Crazy action masterpiece. Easily one of the greatest action films ever made. Right up there with Terminator 2!Mad Max is back in this Sequel/Reboot that blows the other Mad Max films out of the water, In a matter of fact it blows most action films out of the water too, This beautifully shot masterpiece has some of the best action scenes, Car chases and stunts that I've ever seen, It hardly slows down for nothing but when it does we do have an interesting but familiar plot that works very well, Tom Hardy was great fun as Max I wouldn't mind seeing him take up the role again, The effects and practical effects were all amazing, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but I'm betting the 3D would of been great, It's not often a film lives up to the hype but Fury Road is a film that all action fans should watch as it's a modern day classic in many ways.With lots of thrills and top notch action sequences Mad Max Fury road never fails to disappoint.George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run.                                                                               \\n\\nThe movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie.  This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. \\n\\nThe movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.

       "3 Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot.Before I start with my thoughts on this and everything surrounding, let me just say that, FINALLY, the DC Extended Universe gets one right with this movie.  You don't know how long I've been waiting to say those words.  Though, to be fair, after The Dark Knight Trilogy (THE best superhero trilogy bar none), I haven't kept up with any of DC's efforts to create its own massive universe.  I find Superman to be interminably boring, so I had no interest (outside of Michael Shannon) in seeing Man of Steel.  DC, in my opinion, made the wrong choice to keep Batman dark and brooding after The Dark Knight Trilogy so, again, I had no real interest in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice outside of maybe seeing Wonder Woman.  DC has done a poor job at building its own extended universe so, once again, I had no interest in the Justice League movie.  You see how it is.  Of the movies in this universe, the only one I've seen was Suicide Squad, which, while decent, wasn't good and squandered its potential.  Wonder Woman was the only shining beacon of hope in the horizon, the chance to (finally) do a female superhero movie right.  Elektra and Catwoman both sucked and Marvel, since their ascent, wasted their chance to be first in this race by not doing a Black Widow movie.  Here's the thing though, before I get to Wonder Woman, and I've mentioned this a lot, but DC Comics is essentially playing catch-up with Marvel.  That's why you see them bumbling and fumbling major movies, because they know they have to catch up, since Marvel has, pretty much had a monopoly on this superhero movie business since Iron Man came out in 2008.  The thing about Marvel is that they knew they couldn't rush things, they had to slowly plant the seeds for something bigger and, now, you see that that patience has paid off immensely.  I don't know how much money the MCU has raked in for Disney (and this is counting merchandising, DVD sales and other forms of revenue), but it has to be a multi-billion dollar franchise for Disney.  DC hasn't had the same patience, as they're following the same template without understanding why it worked in the first place.  It can't be all at once, it has to be done little by little.  Rome wasn't built in a day and DC has attempted to build Rome (with its extended universe) in 20 minutes.  But, at the same time, DC wasn't always a point of mockery.  DC characters were the first to make the transition from comic to successful major motion pictures with Superman (in 1978) and Batman (in 1989).  Marvel was playing catch-up to DC in the era following Batman's successful release.  They released some truly awful movies in the 90s, like Captain America in 1990 and The Fantastic Four in 94, which was so bad that it hasn't been released yet.  There may have been others, but those are the major ones that pop to mind.  So, in DC's defense, they can still make something of their universe.  But, and to me this is most important, the whole thing needs to not be so dark and serious.  Marvel has succeeded in large part because they know how to pace their movies.  They know that you need comedy in movies like this.  It can't be all darkness and brooding characters struggling with their own moral dilemmas about what is right and what is wrong.  The whole look of the films also needs some more life injected into them.  Marvel movies are diverse in settings and cinematography, so, in spite of being set in the same universe, the MCU films feel different tonally and visually.  In the DC, every movie sort of looks the same.  With a dark, grey and blue hue.  And, as great as this movie is, once they get to London, it's really more of the same in terms of visuals.  Having said all of that, let's move on shall we?  I'm honestly quite surprised that DC waited THIS long to make a Wonder Woman movie, particularly when, to me, this is the movie that should have started your whole extended universe.  This should have been the starting point for all things DCEU.  Firstly, if we're doing this in chronological order so, technically, this should have been first and, secondly, it's a great movie, so you start off with this and people would actually be pumped for the DCEU instead of looking at things so cynically now.  Because as things are now, Wonder Woman feels like the exception to the rule that DCEU movies aren't exactly good.  It's an asterisk.  And that's not to minimize this film's significance, because I do like the shift and I feel that DC knows that, at least for this moment in time, Wonder Woman is its most important character.  People have seen Superman and they've seen Batman and that's not to say that they're tired of the same shit, because there's still many fanboys/girls out there, but I think people want something that's new in that universe and Wonder Woman provides that for people.  So that's why, in my opinion, DC needs to worry far more about Wonder Woman, as she needs to be their top priority, for your cinematic universe going forward as opposed to the old, familiar faces.  Having said that, let's get going, shall we?  I think first I need to talk about Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman.  At first, honestly, I didn't get it.  Don't get me wrong, Gal Gadot is a very talented and attractive woman, but I just didn't get IT for the longest time.  But, having finally seen her as this character, I understand the decision to cast her in the role.  Firstly, for some reason or another, she's even more stunningly beautiful as Wonder Woman than even I imagined.  Plus, honestly, I find she brings all the values to the character that she needs.  So, in my opinion, it's a good combination of both.  Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) herself comes from a long line of Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus in order to protect mankind, really, from itself.  Ares, the god of war, being tots jelly of humanity, decided to plot its destruction by influencing them and his influence leading to the humans starting wars against each other.  Ares has also killed all of the gods with the exception of Zeus himself.  Zeus used the last of his power to wound Ares and making him retreat.  Long story short, Zeus essentially hid Themyscira (the island the Amazons live in) to keep from Ares from finding it and left them a weapon called the Godkiller for Ares' return.  Blah, blah, blah, long story short, Steve Trevor (an Allied spy) crashes his plane off the coast of Themyscira, wherein German soldiers follow him and there, they fight against the Amazonian women who, after losing some of their own, including Diana's aunt, defeat the German soldiers.  Steve, after telling them about the Great War (WWI) attempts to enlist the help of the Amazonian women in order to turn the tide of war, but Hippolyta (Diana's mother) has none of it.  Steve has found this notebook by this German doctor that tells of an attempt to create a deadlier form of mustard gas, which he's trying to put a stop to or else millions more will die.  Diana, being incredibly idealistic, figures that this is Ares' return to the world of men and she needs to put a stop to it by killing Ares.  Diana eventually does leave with Steve, she'll never be able to return to Themyscira again as a result.  So, eventually, Steve and Diana make their way to London, where they begin their plan to fight back against the Germans (pre-Hitler) and attempt to put a stop to this deadlier mustard gas.  I will say that the movie does miss a chance to tell an incredibly interesting story of Diana having to adjust to the gender differences once she makes it to London.  Women aren't allowed in the military, they're not even allowed in this war council to discuss an armistice between them and the Germans.  Diana, of course, finds her way in this meeting and she browbeats one of the generals for being a coward, acting as if the lives of his soldiers are less important than his own and not fighting alongside his men.  Women, at least in this point in time, have not been allowed the vote either.  And, honestly, it would have been incredibly interesting to explore that dynamic of Diana, coming from an island where women are clearly superior in every way (even though there's no men) to a place where women are so clearly oppressed.  There's a few hints of it here and there, but I think the movie would have benefited from exploring that dynamic a little bit more, in my opinion.  One of the things I liked about this movie is that, unlike a lot of superhero movies, I do think they try to give a face at the people that are being affected by the war and how that motivates Diana to try and help them, whether it's by driving the German soldiers from this small town or getting rid of Dr. Maru and Ludendorff, the ones not letting this armistice go through and who are also developing the deadlier mustard gas.  There's an interesting debate here that, honestly, I wish the movie would have stuck with.  There comes a point, much later in the film where Diana kills Ludendorff, as has been her goal all along, since she feels Ludendorff is Ares and killing him stops the fighting.  She does, in fact, kill Ludendorf, but the fighting does not stop.  In fact, you could argue, that it gets worse.  Diana questions Steve about why the fighting hasn't stopped and there's a discussion between the two where Steve says that, maybe, just maybe that's just how we are, we're (hard)wired to self-destruct.  There's just something to the idea that Diana believes that only one person is to blame for all of this and by stopping that one person stops the war itself.  It's an interesting idea because it brings to mind the questions that, really, maybe we're not really worth saving in some way, if all we do is keep killing each other every few years.  Not many superhero movies deal with this topic in this way.  But, of course, you could say that it's a bit of a red herring given that, in fact, Ludendorff was not Ares and, instead, was someone they considered an ally.  But it's interesting to explore regardless, given that Diana is still so naive about certain things in 'modern' times and how her idealistic values and ideas aren't shared by everyone around her.  I think that's probably one of the best thing this movie does, just sort of explore the idea that not everyone shares Diana's values and how, in a way, her views are sort either antiquated, ahead of their time or both.  Steve, who's been helpful to her every step of the way, does stand in her way in some scenes before, of course, Diana takes matter into her own hands.  Diana and Steve's relationship is also one of the strongest points of the movies.  This is in large part, of course, to how great Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are, their chemistry is excellent and, while the movie does contain a romantic angle between the two, it doesn't feel forced or unnatural.  As I mention, Gal Gadot's performance is very strong.  She's a badass, but she also brings heart and life to the character.  She's not necessarily a goody two-shoes like Captain America, but they share some similarities in how they view the world.  You can see how people would be drawn to her kind and compassionate nature and that's not something that, say, a lot of actors playing superheroes are able to capture.  The film does have a good bit of action and it is pretty damn good all things considered.  There were some parts that I felt were too Zak Snyder-y, like the whole slo-mo things that Zak Snyder abused in 300.  But, at the very least, in this case, it can be explained by the fact that one of Diana's superpowers is seeing bullets in slo-mo, which allows her to deflect them before they harm her or anybody.  So, at least, it's not a stylistic choice that was abused, it has actual significance.  The action gets a thumbs up from me as if that wasn't obvious.  So you know how I mentioned earlier that the movie touches on the fact that, maybe, humanity isn't worth saving if all we are is doomed to destroy ourselves.  Well, later on in the movie, Diana comes to the realization that, in spite of everything, humanity is worth fighting for.  One of the things I didn't like, there's actually a couple of minor issues I had, is the fact that the whole ending of Diana saying that she believes love will end up saving us is really kind of corny and cheesy.  Not that the message isn't a worthy one, it's just how it's handled.  And, really, Steve's ultimate act of sacrifice was one made for love, so it makes sense that Diana would believe that, it's execution is still a bit corny.  Another thing that bothered me is that, ultimately, the fighting DID stop after Diana killed Ares and, I don't know, I feel like that's too simplistic of a conclusion for something as complex as the first World War.  I like the earlier themes which, while certainly more bleak (and that's something DCEU could do to remove from its movies), it's still a better conclusion and, at the same time, Diana can still come to the same conclusion she did as a result of Steve's actions.  Minor issues, really, as it didn't really affect my overall enjoyment of the film.  Having said that, do I think that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made?  No, not really.  It's the best movie based on one of DC's properties since the Dark Knight Trilogy finished off in 2012.  It's a great superhero movie, with a strong origin story at its core, great performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and a more humanistic approach to its conflict, in that the people Diana and Steve are trying to save aren't entirely faceless as they usually are in these movies (even in the MCU).  But, at the same time, there's nothing really about this movie that extends the boundaries of what we know the superhero genre to be.  It works solely within that framework.  And there's nothing wrong with that but, to me, the best superhero movies transcend their framework to become something more, something fresh within this genre and, honestly, I don't think this offered anything fresh.  Maybe that's just me.  Regardless of all of that, this is still a great superhero movie and, as mentioned, this should have been DC's first step in their attempts to create their own cinematic universe.  As such, we cannot turn back time and, as I mentioned earlier, Wonder Woman should be DC's top priority right now.  Wonder Woman needs to be the centerpiece of their extended universe if they want to come close to rivaling Marvel.  Or even just being a strong number 2.  They're number 2 by default, but they're not a strong number 2.  With that said, this is a great start to this franchise and I'm eagerly looking forward to more from this character and how DC decides to expand the character.  I would easily recommend this.The fourth movie in the current DC extended universe that has been exploding onto our screens with much aplomb. Well actually no it hasn't but that was the idea wasn't it. So far things have been a bit dodgy to say the least, could this movie turn the tide? Well according to just about everyone this movie did seem to do just that. So has the movies popularity, hype and praise swayed me in any way? Is it justified? Or do we have yet another [i]Ghostbusters[/i] (2016) scenario? \\n\\nThe movie is basically a prequel to the 2016 movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' whereby it shows the origins of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), whilst at the same time connecting to the events that occur within BvS. The fact its this way around is of course due to WB's lack of patience and coordination in their comicbook universe building (playing catch up with Marvel as fast as possible). The plot however pans out as you might expect, in the usual comicbook fashion. We learn about Diana's homeland, her culture and people. We learn about a pending almighty evil that threatens everything. Outsider shows up and ends up helping Diana in her quest to find and eliminate evil. A bit of exposition, some minor alternate bad guys to deal with, a few key battles and then one big CGI finale.\\n\\nMuch like the recent 'Kong: Skull Island' (2017) I had an initial problem with the fictional Amazonian homeland of Themyscira. This place appears to be a very large group of islands plopped in the middle of an ocean somewhere. The problem being it appears to be hidden by a perpetual weather system and some kind of invisibility force field. Obviously this is a fantasy movie so something like this shouldn't really matter. But the entire notion that no one has ever stumbled across this rather large place, and reported it, just seems completely unbelievable. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that when German forces actually find this location (whilst chasing a downed Steve Trevor), they simply start to attack! Why would they do that?? Such an important discovery like that. Also what exactly happened to the German ship? Did the force field sink it?\\n\\nThe story moves swiftly on as we follow Diana and Steve (Chris Pine) back to London (its 1918). The plan: Steve simply wants to hand back some important stolen information regarding Nazi gas weapon advancements (Steve was an undercover spy). Where as Diana wants to find the evil God Ares and kill him so she can stop WWI. Diana has basically been brainwashed all about Zeus and his dastardly son who wants to wipe out mankind (Zeus' creation) because he thinks they are a destructive race. She believes Ares is the cause of WWI and she can stop it. The thing this narrative becomes extremely annoying truth be told because Diana never shuts up about it. \\n\\nDiana is essentially very naive and genuinely curious about this new outside world. She clearly has no idea of gender, society rules and the fact that people might treat each other differently. She finds these human elements and more (such as not helping people in need or acting carelessly with other lives), completely reprehensible. She simply does not understand how people could act this way. The thing is, I found it quite grating after a time because Diana mentions it in almost every scene! I fully understood the need to show and express her emotions on these factors but Jesus, you can truly feel Steve's frustration as he tries to help and explain to her. Good acting? Sure, still annoying to listen to over and over though.\\n\\nThis being a 2017 movie I also understand the requirements for diversity and whatnot. So when it came to Steve's little band of merry men, naturally they were gonna be a diverse bunch. I had no problem with this except for a few tiny details. Firstly, the crazy Scot, surely they could of cast someone other than Ewen Bremner, such predictable and safe casting. Then my other gripe was the native American character. No problem including the guy, but did they have native Americans in the trenches in WWI? Hey I could be wrong but this kinda felt like they were going for a bit [b]too[/b] much diversity there. Kinda reaching a bit methinks. Also would they really wear their native attire? In other words would Sameer from Morocco (I'm guessing) go around wearing a fez in a wartime situation? Would the Chief Napi go around dressed like a cowboy or hunter? Shouldn't they be wearing protective clothing? Yeah I'm being picky I know.\\n\\nI have to admit the Wonder Woman theme tune is very catchy and it does work well here. The action scenes are very well executed and look terrific, but when that score kicks in it does get your adrenaline fired up a bit that's for sure. The entire movie looks good in general but I put that down to the charming period setting of the early 1900's and WWI. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has noticed that movies shot during either world wars always seem to look very authentic and adventurous. Indeed this movie like others ('The Rocketeer', 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark/Last Crusade', 'Captain America: The First Avenger' etc...) looks authentic, adventurous and harrowing all at the same time. There is a fine balance between the horrors of war and a rollicking comicbook yarn, and its upheld nicely here. Dare I say a bit darker than the first Captain America movie.\\n\\nI think its safe to say the best sequence is where we get our first glimpse of Wonder Woman in battle. She disrobes in front of the stunned allied troops and simply strolls out into no man's land sword and shield at the ready. Other than that things tended to get a bit CGI obvious for me. In the first battle Diana is leaping around like a frog and merely throwing Germans all over the shop. I'm sure they would have been killed or badly injured but it felt like more of a cop out in the heat of the moment. I wanted to see her run troops through, slice n dice. The German soldiers also became obvious CGI ragdolls once launched.\\n\\nThe finale was also a bit weak in my opinion. Firstly Diana kills off the main German baddie (Danny Huston) on a packed base, yet no one seemingly cares. Then she fights Ares who turns out to be the elderly David Thewlis! Now don't get me wrong, it was quite refreshing to see a villain not played by some roided up meathead. But watching Thewlis become this electrical power wielding super God was a tad silly. Twas also a bit silly seeing these two superheroes slug it out on one side of this military base; then on the other side mortals are fighting their puny war. Oh and Diana lets the evil Doctor poison go in the end too? Like wut??!! Is that female privilege?\\n\\nSo was this as good as all the hype? Yes and no for me. Its certainly a solid superhero flick, its better than virtually all the DC offerings, and it gives some Marvel efforts a good run for their money too. The main problem for me is simple, superhero fatigue. There have been so many of these movies now, and most are generally the same spiel. Its really hard to watch a single superhero movie now and [b]not[/b] think I've seen it all before. But that's because I have, you could essentially swap out Wonder Woman here for any other superhero character, and it would still work the same. So yes its a good solid movie, but its nothing special, it does nothing overly original.The movie is at its best when it focuses on the quieter character moments and when it embraces the weirder elements of the comics (the prominent use of the \"Lasso of Truth\"  is wonderful) some of the action sequences are a little flat but that's to be expected.\n",
       "4 Pixar...what else can you say? They can tell a story as well as anyone ever, and better than most. This is a moving film with lots to say about family and music. Of course I loved it. Of course I could tell where it was probably going. I didn't care. I laughed and cried. It reminded me of my mother-in-law Ruth at one point. I connected with it completely. Great movie.I'm starting this review a few hours before, I'm assuming, I watch tonight's featured film, so I may not finish this review in time given that I seem to wax poetic whenever I'm reviewing Pixar movies.  Look, I've mentioned this a lot when reviewing their movies, but it's obvious that since this Disney mandated sequelitis, with Pixar releasing four sequels starting in 2011 with Cars 2 whereas, prior to that, they had only released two sequels (Toy Story 2 and 3) in the preceding 15 years prior to that point.  I suppose you could make the argument that this heavy focus on sequels started with Toy Story 3, but I don't like to count that since, unlike the other sequels they've done since, it felt like a natural continuation of the story established in the previous films.  Toy Story 4, in my opinion, doesn't make sense because, to me, they've already finished that story and that narrative.  While I've no doubt that Toy Story 4 will deliver the goods, there's no real angle to justify a sequel, creatively at least, since, again, the toys got the send-off they deserved in the third flick.  That's neither here nor there, I suppose, but it's obvious that Disney has pushed them towards this route, given that sequels are easier sells than original films, with all the merchandising deals they can make.  I felt that Pixar even hinted at this with a character in Cars 3.  I'm not getting into that, since I already went over it in the review for that movie.  But, again, it's been a really long time since, to me, Pixar felt like Pixar.  As great as Inside Out and Finding Dory were, I felt like they were a step below Pixar's standards.  Inside Out had some repetitiveness and Finding Dory, well, it was great, but it just wasn't excellent.  Having said that, Inside Out was great and it showed that Pixar's true passion lies in creating new stories and exploring new horizons.  While I had my issues with Inside Out, it was a glimpse that Pixar still had it in them to create stories that really do hit home.  Particularly Inside Out since, essentially, it was a movie about mental illness, a very real topic.  And it explored that topic with all the intelligence and warmth we've come to expect from Pixar.  This brings us to Coco and, goddamnit, if this isn't the best movie Pixar has made in, honestly, almost a decade.  Toy Story 3 (a modern classic) was released 8 years ago and nothing of theirs, since then, has even come close to that.  Well, that is, until this little gem of a movie came along.  I suppose I should get this out of the way first, and it might be a controversial statement to some (particularly if you're a crackpot right-winger), but Mexican mythology/folklore is superior to its American equivalent in every way, shape or form.  I'm not talking about one country being superior to the other, that's not what I'm saying at all (though the U.S has one MAJOR, orange flaw in their midst).  What I'm saying is that stuff like this, that explores Dia de los Muertos and its significance in that culture is so rich and detailed and, really, there's nothing that can even rival that in the States.  There's nothing.  I'm willing to wait it out if you do have something that comes close to that or the decorative skulls and, again, its significance to that culture and the Dia de los Muertos.  There's a movie similar to this one, called The Book of Life and, really, the similarities are skin-deep, because while the movie definitely delves into the other side, where spirits of the dead go after they, you know, die, I think this movie goes into more detail regarding the day and the offerings people make in order to, quite literally, allow their loved ones to visit them and see how they are doing.  This is one of the more important aspects of the movie, since, if a person does not have a photo of them put up as part of an offering, they can't cross to the other side and see their living loved ones.  Another important thing to note is that the dead aren't in the 'other side' forever.  The moment the last person who remembers them is gone (as in dead) they fade away into who knows what.  This is important to the narrative.  Anyway, let's move on.  The movie looks at Miguel, a 12-year-old kid who wants to be a musician when he grows up.  There's just one caveat and that is that his great-great-grandmother banned music in their family when her husband, a musician, abandoned her with her daughter to pursue his dreams of becoming famous.  Miguel, disillusioned but not giving up, has a guitar stashed away in a secret room along with video tapes of his favorite singer/actor/everything awesome, Ernesto De La Cruz.  Long story short, Miguel finds a photo that leads him to believe that De La Cruz is a relative of his.  After an incident where Miguel's grandmother breaks his guitar for refusing to listen to her, he runs away to a mausoleum, where De La Cruz's coffin is at, complete with his signature guitar.  He takes the guitar, stealing from the dead on the Dia de los Muertos, is a big no-no, so he is sent to the other side.  This is where he meets his long-dead relatives (whose photos are on the offering table their family has set-up).  Basically, being sent back to the land of the living, Miguel just has to get a blessing from one of his relatives.  His great-grandmother does so on the condition that he give up music.  Miguel reluctantly agrees, but proceeds to take the guitar and is, again, sent back to the land of the dead.  This is where the movie picks up, with Miguel going on a journey to find De La Cruz in order to get HIS blessing, since he approves of Miguel pursuing his career.  Miguel teams up with a trickster named Hector, who apparently knows De La Cruz.  Hector helps Miguel on the condition that, when Miguel comes back to the land of the living, he put up Hector's picture on the offering table, so he can come back to the land of the living and see his daughter one last time.  The thing about the movie and its narrative is that it is very easy to figure out what the 'twist' is gonna be.  And, you know what, I felt like that didn't actually hamper my enjoyment of the movie at all.  In fact, in some ways, I felt that it added to my enjoyment.  Exploring the theme of death in a film like this, one that's aimed at a family audience, is definitely very tricky.  Obviously you have to do it in a way that teaches you something about who we are as human beings and how we treat our dead.  Also, it's intriguing because, again, movies like this just try to shy away from that theme, but not this flick.  I guess it's because, death, is an inherent part of Mexican culture.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, in the slightest, it's just that, if you're a believer, then death really isn't the end.  Regardless of whether or not you can interact with your deceased loved ones, you can, according to the offerings, allow them a glimpse into your life to show them that, still, you have them in your hearts and your thoughts.  And, really, as much as I'm not a superstitious man, I find that there's a lot of beauty in that.  Beauty that is explored thoroughly in this movie cause, in spite of it all, this is a story about family and the love of that family keeping the spirits of their deceased loved ones alive.  As far as the narrative goes, again, there's some predictability, but that doesn't detract from how emotionally engaging the movie really is.  Hector is a man that you sympathize with and, this might be very spoiler heavy (YOU'VE BEEN WARNED), his journey to see his daughter one last time is emotionally heart-wrenching.  Hector is a man, who was murdered by De La Cruz (who stole all his songs and became famous off of them), who just wants to see his daughter one last time.  Which is what he was about to do when he was poisoned by De La Cruz.  There's something he mentions, since it's teased that Hector is just about to fade away (given that his daughter is dying) and it's that the only chance he has to see his daughter and, the moment she dies, is the moment he fades away.  So he can't even see his daughter in the land of the dead and there's something, honestly, quite heartbreaking about that.  He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.  That's why you sympathize with him and root for him all the way until he finally gets his wish to be put up on an offering table to visit his family on the Dia de los Muertos.  The movie, obviously is steeped in Mexican culture and, while I'm not Mexican, you can see that these people really fucking did their research.  It's not an exploitation of that culture, it is a celebration of the culture and everything that encompasses it.  And I think that's the best thing about this movie, because there's a certain apprehension one feels when you hear that Pixar is tackling Mexican culture in one of their films.  You just feel that they might not get it right.  But, again, in my opinion, they did a wonderful job at exploring the culture, it doesn't poke fun at the superstitious nature of the people and, again, it just celebrates the beauty (really) in the Dia de los Muertos celebration.  Of course, and this should go without saying, that the animation is, literally, out of this world.  I can't even imagine how gorgeous this movie would look on a 4K television.  But it's not just the beauty and, again, this is something that I've mentioned a lot in my Pixar reviews, it's just the amount of detail they put into even the tiniest of things.  And, honestly, it's the sort of thing that you'd really have to watch the movie multiple times to catch on.  There's a reason these people are the best at what they do, because they've got some of the best animators working for them.  I honestly can't rave enough about them.  As I mentioned, the story goes to some very interesting places and it's a very engaging film from beginning to end.  Of course, the movie being the way it is, there's some very emotional moments.  But, again, it doesn't feel unearned.  The film's world is so well-constructed and the characters so well-developed that it doesn't feel manipulative in the slightest.  Miguel singing Hector's song that he wrote for his young daughter who's now, clearly, in her 90s and nearly dying is...oh god, the feels were too strong with that one.  But, again, in spite of that and those definitely very emotional moments, it all adds up to a lovely and beautiful result.  Death, in this universe and culture, is not seen as the bad thing that it is in the U.S.   It is just the next step and, as long as you keep their memory alive in your hearts, then they'll always be there.  That sounds very cliched, but it's a sentiment that this movie explores beautifully.  The voice acting is excellent, as it almost always is in these movies.  The kid who plays Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) is tremendous, Gael Garcia Bernal is tremendous.  To avoid repeating myself too much, everyone here is tremendous as far as voice acting is concerned.  I don't really know what else I can say about this movie.  I'm not saying this is one of Pixar's best because, considering their track record, it's not.  But it's also not far from that level either.  This is a fantastic movie and, really, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss out on this, particularly now that it's on Netflix.  Highly recommended and I loved absolutely every second of this.This may actually be PIxar's least funny film, but that's beside the point. It actually succeeds in everything it sets out to do: tell a beautifully animated and deeply touching story while paying respect to a fascinating Mexican tradition. The visuals are breath-taking and the story so sweet, you have to admire that the film somewhat holds back on the usual slapstick and sticks to its very humane message. Adorable and a feast for all senses!Coco is an extravagant tale of culture and ambition that's exemplary in all aspects: sights, sound and story. The film touts its vibrant layout, rhythmic vibes and overall heartfelt tone that hits home deeply and more uniquely in a fashion befitting of Disney & Pixar . 4.97/5

       "5 From Christopher Nolan comes the World War II epic Dunkirk.  It doesn't really have a plot as such, but instead attempts to recreate a visceral experience as it following an anonymous soldier on the beach waiting for rescue, a pilot patrolling the sky, and a civilian boat captain making way for Dunkirk in response to the government's call for aid.  There isn't very much dialog, and what little there is is rather incidental and only reveals fragments of the Dunkirk battle/evacuation.  However, Nolan conveys so much through his use of the camera and the images, that little is needed.  The desperation and enormity of the situation comes through, and is quite powerful.  Despite its lack of narrative, Dunkirk is a compelling war film.Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.Christopher Nolan's latest offering is an accurate representation of an event that occurred in 1940 during WWII. British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. \\n\\nSituated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue. Up to 400 various manned craft were voluntarily used and braved the English Channel along with various military vessels. Despite the fact that German forces had halted their crushing advance on Dunkirk (giving the Allies some time to organise the evac), the Luftwaffe were still hitting the port and its beaches and enemy troops were still on the ground.\\n\\nNolan's film tells the story of Dunkirk from separate angles, land sea and air. The first angle is from a young British private called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who has survived a recent German ambush and has made his way to the beaches. We follow Tommy as he tries to get on-board a couple ships only for them to be sunk by German attacks. Tommy eventually ends up back on the beaches with some Scottish soldiers and a French soldier. The second angle is from RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and two other Spitfire pilots who are part of the British airborne resistance against the German bombers. And the third angle is from a Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son Peter and his sons best friend George. All of whom have volunteered to help in the rescue with the aid of Mr. Dawson's yacht.\\n\\nFirst off Nolan's film is not like most traditional films. There is very little dialog throughout the entire runtime; instead Nolan relies on pure visuals and the musical score to convey the films atmosphere. That is where the film may be problematic for many people, this isn't a war movie filled with blood, guts, gun battles and explosions. Obviously if you know about the actual historical event then you would know to expect this. The most dialog comes from the story surrounding Mr. Dawson and his son Peter, second to that would probably be Tommy's story, then lastly and most obviously is Farrier's story which is almost entirely conveyed through Tom Hardy's facial expressions.\\n\\nNow whilst I did fully appreciate Nolan's vision here, I have to admit to finding it somewhat odd watching a movie like this with little dialog. Looking at Farrier's story (the air section), it was indeed very impressive to watch these old Spitfires dogfight with German Messerschmitt's. Naturally it wasn't shot in the typical Hollywood action sequence type way. What you get are highly realistic air sequences which show the planes trying to manoeuvre into position to be able to attack each other. When the attacks come they are short bursts with very little fanfare. When a plane gets hit nothing much happens at first. The pilots communications are brief and not filled with silly quips. Basically overall it kinda feels like you're watching some kind of airshow display or training video, the fact everything is shot in natural light kinda adds to that.\\n\\nThe story surrounding Tommy is probably the most Hollywood-esque part of the movie, but it still may not please some. Once again this is a highly realistic vision, there are no 'Saving Private Ryan' sequences on this beach. The plot is straight forward, Tommy and another soldier try to board ships by using an injured soldier as their ticket essentially. That seems almost wrong but in the grand scheme of things who wouldn't do that? The fact that they try to get away twice and both times the ships are sunk did seem almost too unlucky to me. The fact that later on they reach another ship and yet again it gets sunk, kinda felt a bit overly dramatic perhaps. Did that many ships get sunk in the real event? \\n\\nTommy's tale certainly has the most cinematic visuals of the film, the numerous shots of the troops lined up on the beach are incredibly haunting, yet beautiful. Its easily the most intriguing of the three main plots but at the same time its also a bit too 'Spielbergian' methinks. When Tommy meets up with the Scottish soldiers things get a tad by the numbers and a little dull. I also felt the death of the French soldier (who was thought to be a Brit) was again a little touch of Hollywood which maybe wasn't required. It was too predictable, the minute he is exposed as French you kinda knew his number was up. I should add that whilst all this is going on we get little snippets of Kenneth Branagh as a Commander overseeing the operation from the beach. Again like Hardy he tends to emote through facial expressions more than dialog. \\n\\nFor me the weakest of the stories was following Mr. Dawson and his son. Call me shallow but this was simply because it wasn't really that interesting. I found myself yearning for the plot to get back to the beaches, or in the air with Farrier. Don't get me wrong, Mark Rylance puts in a great performance as the calm and steadfast Dawson, and its important to see the civilian angle of this story. The thing is it just wasn't really that intriguing watching this trio sale slowly towards Dunkirk.\\n\\nThe subplot of them rescuing a stranded officer (Cillian Murphy) from a shipwreck was also something of an odd addition. Murphy's officer is shell-shocked, he argues about going to Dunkirk and tries to stop Dawson. This leads to George (Peter's best friend) falling and badly injuring his head...which leads to his eventual death! I really didn't see the point in all this because it goes nowhere. Dawson and Peter lie to the shell-shocked officer about it and that's kinda that. Neither Dawson or Peter came across as upset when the incident occurred or when George dies. You're left wondering what happens with that. Does the officer get done for murder upon return to England? Would he be let off because of the fact he was shell-shocked?\\n\\nWould I say this is one of the greatest war films ever made? In terms of realism yes. In terms of score, cinematography and craftsmanship yes. In terms of engagement (for me the viewer) I'd say its up there, but maybe not the best. I totally and utterly shower praise on Nolan and co for their vision and what they have achieved here, the authenticity being the number one factor of course (score not far behind). But I cannot deny the film is a little slow at times. I hate myself for saying this but I did find myself yearning for just a touch of romanticised heroism or emotion just to get those waterworks going. \\n\\nThe final sequence showing Farrier taking out one last German bomber before he is forced to land in enemy territory from lack of fuel, was so fecking awesome. Seeing the Spitfire land in one shot on the Dunkirk beach was fantastic, as was seeing a stoic Farrier stare into the camera as he is captured and led away. But dagnabbit Chris, I just needed a hint, a mere drop of glossy sentimentality. The film was [b]so[/b] realistic that it didn't really feel like a film at times (again I hate myself for saying this). But bottom line, this film is a tour de force that ignores manufactured heroics and stereotypical Hollywood-isms.It's gripping, perilous and uniquely envisioned. Dunkirk blends the fine direction of Christopher Nolan and the captivating historical event to put you on the edge emotionally. 4.5/5

       "6 The first time I saw this movie I couldn't really review it properly, I needed more time, I needed to see it again. Truth be told I disliked it on my first viewing...but there were elements I liked. Surely this couldn't be strike two for the new Star Wars trilogy? (I disliked 'The Force Awakens' also). Well this was my second viewing and I now feel I can get into this fully. Thing is, there is literally so much I could say about this movie it could possibly go on and on. So this time I'm gonna go with a slightly new layout. I'm simply gonna list my thoughts in sections and try to keep them as tight as possible.\\n\\nGeneral Hux and the beginning: Twas this opening sequence that really bemused and worried me right away (as it did with many). Hux was a relatively solid slimy character introduced in the previous movie. All the trappings of a weaselly baddie. Alas here he has seemingly been reduced to an actual jokey comedic character that could so easily have been torn from the pages of a spoof. The first real dialog we get is an absolutely horrendous back and forth between Hux and Poe. Poe mocking Hux with his communications tomfoolery, or as we in reality call it, a lame mobile (cell) phone gag.\\n\\nPoe bravely tries to bring down a First Order (Empire) dreadnought during the first space battle. Unfortunately things aren't going too well and the Resistance (Rebels) are being slaughtered. The rebels have one last bomber and one chance to hit their target. In the nick of time the rebel pilot is able to drop the bombs, but how can bombs 'drop' when in space? What about TIE Bombers you say? Well I always thought TIE Bombers fired their bombs downward, like torpedoes essentially, but straight down. That's just me. Also, if you look closely the bomber hangar doors are already open when the pilot triggers the bombs. How was she not sucked out into space?\\n\\nPrincess Leia: Oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We've all heard about this now but I can't just ignore it. Yes we know Leia has force abilities (as we saw in Bespin), and we know its entirely possible she has grown stronger with the force since then. That aside, its still almost impossible to get past how stupid this entire sequence looked and felt. To make matters even worse, when she flies/floats back to the ship, there was no airlock. The rebels simply open the flippin' door! Everyone would have been sucked out into space in a matter of seconds for flips sake. Oh and while we're at it, she suffered absolutely no injuries whilst getting blown out of the exploding ships bridge. No burns, cuts, broken bones, nothing. I'm not even sure how those TIE torpedoes got through the ships shields, I guess they were special torpedoes?\\n\\nThen there is of course the flip side to this stupid scene. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died in 2016 which naturally caused issues for the film. This scene was the perfect ending for Princess Leia under these circumstances. The fact that Fisher is no longer with us surely cemented that. But apparently not, apparently Johnson thought it better to bring her back and give the next director a real headache. The only thing I can think of is they have a large amount of pre-shot footage which they know they can flesh out into the next story. But if that's the case it sure as hell limits things drastically. Oh and they also killed Admiral Ackbar off-screen here too, you bastards!\\n\\nAnch-To and Luke: Adrift in a cold sea on an oceanic planet, this small windswept circular rocky island houses the first Jedi temple and the tree library of the sacred Jedi texts. The inhabitants of this small island? Small cutesy flightless (I think) bird-like creatures that get everywhere. And 'the caretakers', dwarf sized toad-like creatures that appear to dress like century old nuns. Both races are completely unexplained and are completely useless to the plot. The Porgs merely serve as fluffy comedic relief, whilst the caretakers look like they belong in a 'Labyrinth' sequel. The only creature we briefly see that grabbed my attention was the sea monster breaking the surface in the background.\\n\\nAs with the Leia controversy I'm sure everyone now knows about the Luke controversy. Apart from milking large alien sea mammals for blue milk and generally being a grouch, there was also the lightsaber tossing moment. I'm not gonna dwell on it...but yes it was totally a 'fuck you' to the fanbase from director Rian Johnson. It was also a pathetic Disneyfied attempt at light humour. They basically used a powerful emotional moment in the plot for a quick laugh. Oh it was a plot twist you say? Keep em'.\\n\\nCanto Bight: Ugh! Sorry just raising my head outta my hands. Well I guess if anyone wanted something more akin to a Lucas movie this was it. Alas more akin to the worst of the Lucas prequels. Yep this entire subplot was completely unnecessary and really ugly looking. A super rich casino city located on planet Cantonica, its packed with super rich alien lifeforms and humans (most of whom appeared to be white? Even all the city police were white men, interesting). Anyway this was the segment where Johnson (under orders of Disney I assume) added the core liberal commentary on our present day society. War profiteering, animal cruelty, slavery etc...its all here, all the juicy stuff. Unfortunately most average people don't wanna  see this kind of stuff crowbarred into a Star Wars movie, not so blatantly for no real reason anyway. At least try with some flippin' subtly. It was really no surprise that this subplot surrounded the new character of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) who herself was the epitome of a token politically correct character.\\n\\nDJ (Benicio del Toro): Another very pointless character if you ask me. Stupid name, stupid way of talking. I suppose he's the Lando of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if he pops up again. Main question surrounding him, I wonder just who did that ship he pinched belong to. The owner of which was selling ships to both the Resistance and First Order. A possible set up for later on?\\n\\nSnoke: So he dies, yeah that went nowhere or so we think. I didn't mind that he died (a decent twist for me) but the way it happened seemed silly to me. This bloke is all powerful with the dark side but couldn't detect Kylo Ren moving a lightsaber that was inches from his person?? I guess Kylo could have clouded his mind or whatever but wouldn't he detect that too? I dunno. Plus his personal guards seemed to be useless. Rey showing her invincibility again...despite being revealed as a nobody. Oh and neither Rey nor Kylo actually use any force powers in that fight, eh?\\n\\nVice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern): In short, a very unlikeable character who looked like a middle aged woman having a midlife crisis (the purple hair). At first it literally seemed like she was just there to put the men (the flyboys) in their place with a show of Disney backed feminism (anyone else notice that both the Resistance and First Order seem to have had a major female recruitment campaigns? I'm fine with the ladies in here but Jesus talk about beyond obvious). Amazingly it turns out that Poe's plans were the wrong route after all and Holdo was in fact correct (another decent twist). The problem is, by the time this happens I was so against Holdo that it just didn't matter anymore. They made her so unlikeable that it was too late to turn that around. Oh and all this technology but a major ship doesn't have autopilot? Really?\\n\\nYoda: Very cool (hehe) but why not Ben? Or Anakin? Or Qui-Gon? And force ghosts can now do stuff? They can make things happen in the realms of the living? And again another case of Johnson trying to throw out Star Wars lore and legend by having Yoda destroy the Jedi texts (although we see later they weren't...somehow).\\n\\nCrait: Ah the Hoth battle bit. I guess it was too hard for Johnson and co not to copy the original trilogy. Seeing as before this we had a copy of the Emperor's throne room with Luke from 'Return of the Jedi' (Kylo, Rey and Snoke). And a copy of the asteroid sequence with the Falcon from 'Empire Strikes Back' (Falcon in the Crait caves). Anyway this time the Resistance have about 15 people left (although in the next shot we see dozens more soldiers outta nowhere), and they're up against an even bigger force from the First Order. Same layout as before, the Resistance base door behind a long trench with a few gun turrets. \\n\\nSalt!: Yes that's right, random Resistance fighter #5 luckily points out for us that the surface of Crait (or that area) is covered in salt. Just in case you mistook it for snow. You know, just in case you thought they were trying to copy the Hoth battle (insert eye roll here). Thing is, why did he do that? He could of killed himself, its an alien planet, you don't just stick random things in your mouth for Pete's sake. Is this the new Ridley Scott method of alien world exploration?\\n\\nThe First Order use around 10 brand new AT-M6 walkers (with a few older AT-AT's for some reason), TIE's, Kylo's shuttle, and superlaser siege cannon. The Resistance use these old speeders (V-4X-D) which required a sort of rudder that stabilised them. I guess they must have been very old designs? The battle is indeed a fun highlight but is utterly stupid as the goodies should of been wiped out in minutes. In fact its so stupid I'm not even sure what they were attempting to do with those speeders. They certainly didn't have firepower to take on the walkers and they couldn't shoot at the TIE's. Its also here where Finn should of died in an emotional sacrificial moment of heroism...but he's saved by that idiot Rose which in turn gave the First Order the victory. Obviously Disney weren't ever gonna kill off their main minority actors, pish posh!\\n\\nLuke (again): So Luke dies...but why? It is shown Luke is using force projection to confront Kylo (a controversial aspect in itself). Are we to presume he was exhausted after using this power? So much so that he died? Maybe this ability is so powerful that it drains the users life force. Maybe that's why we've never seen it before? Maybe only the strongest most force sensitive Jedi can do it? Kinda makes you wonder why no one has ever used it before. Ben Kenobi could have used it against Vader when confronting him on the Death Star (if strong enough). Ditto Yoda against Count Dooku etc...Also have to ask why he projected himself looking younger, for Leia's sake?\\n\\nTo sum up, looking closer this is really 'Empire Strikes Back', its just not as obvious. Rebels discovered, Rebels run away, Rebels pursued, Rebels lose in the end. What's funny is most of this movie is in fact a very slow chase between two very slow moving ships. And this is the first time we've heard about fuel issues in Star Wars also. A few other final little things. Phasma, what was the point? (and why don't all troopers wear her laser proof armour yet?). Nien Nunb's mask still doesn't look as good as the 83 version, how???!!! What the hell was all that crap with multiple Rey's in that hole? And what was that hole suppose to be? (other than another scene copied from EST. Luke in the cave on Dagobah). And the final sequence with that kid and his broom, kinda felt like another prequel-esque moment. Is this kid gonna be important?\\n\\nDid I like this new Star Wars movie? No, I liked bits, and when I say bits I mean bits. I liked the visuals, they were generally a massive improvement over 'The Force Awakens'. I genuinely loved the small chase sequence inside a huge Crait cave with TIE's hot on the Falcon's tail. Not only did this look great, it had some classic Chewie piloting moments plus some actual amusing interactions with the Porgs (dunno why Chewie would allow them to stay on the ship but whatever). The fact this sequence also had some John Williams classic Star Wars score along with it almost brought me to tears. I liked Snoke and his death (yup). Twas cool to see a big baddie go down so quickly and easily, unique. I also liked the First Order presence on Crait as it looked badass, alas nothing much happens with it. \\n\\nBut overall I was again disappointed with the final product [b]although[/b] I will say I did enjoy it just that little more than 'The Force Awakens'. I'm really not so sure what they're gonna do going forward and the fact Abrams is back doesn't fill me with confidence.The first of the Star Wars franchise to saturate itself with that which everyone only talks about in the other outings: The Force. Duh. It's all anybody talks about, but hardly seen enough, used enough. But this one investigates just a little, eh? About time. And what about The Force? Does ability to access it's power guarantee happiness, for instance? Nooooooo, and the story follows those who can do so, and those poor souls who can't, making it the best Star Wars since ... The Empire Strikes Back. All this, and the set-up for what comes next. Well done indeed.Rather underwhelming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens.  After a costly attack on the First Order, the Resistance is depleted of resources and retreats to a fortified moon base for a last stand; meanwhile Ray pleads with a reluctant Luke Skywalker to train her to be a Jedi.  None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage, Snoke's possible Jedi/Sith connection, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren, etc.  The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same.  In fact, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones.  Still, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic.  And the special effects are especially well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs.  While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).It doesn't end with a space battle. It does begin with one though. And it does still come down to stopping a big laser from destroying what is positioned as the final stronghold of the resistance. This is The Last Jedi simplified, of course, but the point is, patterns. Stanzas. Everything in Star Wars, since the days of George Lucas, has worked in this recurring metrical unit where the past predicts the future and the future dictates the fate of our favorite characters. There is a great sense of scope and history in these films and with Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper) has utilized this rich history in a way that kind of upends those patterns. Those verses that were seemingly an inherent part of the Star Wars DNA. Typically, this would be something unexpected, but applauded as it would lead one to believe there are bold choices being made and new directions being taken and while this is true to a certain extent, what happens when you don't always like or agree with the choices being made or the direction being taken? With The Force Awakens J.J. Abrams created a revival for a new generation balancing the tasks of paying respects to the previous trilogy, setting-up new parts of the universe to be explored, and establishing a new generation of characters that fans could fall in love with. Key to this was Abrams backdrop of this great mythos and grandeur that only hinted at the darkness that had befallen the characters of the original trilogy since we'd last seen them. The Last Jedi would then seemingly follow through on the promise of this mythical status that had befallen Luke Skywalker and so there was much to be excited for going forward in the series. In fact, The Force Awakens put in place so much to build this aura of mystery and gravity that it was probably impossible for Johnson to deliver on all of them, but with the re-introduction of Mark Hamill's Skywalker here it is clear this is in fact, \"not going to go the way we (or at least I) thought,\" as Johnson immediately dispels this sense of mysticism in favor of a joke. A moment of deadpan humor that put me in a hesitant state of mind from which I don't know that I ever recovered. I've now seen the movie twice and I felt the same way both times. To be clear, I'm more than up for a movie that is self-aware to the point of not taking itself too seriously, but this almost broad comical direction and unwillingness to divulge that rich history or take advantage of it in the way The Force Awakens so gracefully set it up is nothing short of disappointing and may in fact be the most depressing aspect of what The Last Jedi seemingly promised and failed to deliver.\\n\\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com

       "1 \"Black Panther\" lived up to the hype.When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, \"Black Panther\" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender.Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times. And the final scene isn't the requisite pause before the next Marvel movie, but a genuine Moment. It's an emotionally rousing expression of why this movie matters, flaws and all.It's a powerful package.Black Panther is one of Marvel's best movies to date and Ryan Coogler has delivered something which is going to have a lasting impact not only on comic book fans but an entire generation. Wakanda Forever!Spectacular diversity magic! Black Panther slashes a lot of things, chiefly colonialism. In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "2 Happy end of the world.Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance.Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller's action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.Fury Road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee-led blockbusters which are built on CGI and designed to sell toys.Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off.I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around, when I'd adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle - not to mention the hilarious sexual politics.Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once.It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it.Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to \"dumb fun.\" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent.Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy.The sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking, and Miller's singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty.Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing, but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3 As befitting the genre, Wonder Woman is heroic and spirited. The fighting sequences are spectacular, and the story is engrossing, uplifting and fun. There's even a bit of romance and humor amid all the action. [Full review in Japanese]\"Wonder Woman\" is a superhero movie, and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre, but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy.Beauty, strength, goodness, bravery: These are your values, and here is how your values must look.Jenkins tries not only to include men on Wonder Woman's side but also to make male viewers feel better about a woman saving them.The final big action sequence, as now seems always to be the case, is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones, even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions.Wonder Woman embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace in a mainstream delivery system. And the female lead is not solely a mother, sister, girlfriend or hooker, however gold her heart: wonder of wonders!Gadot - who I'm not yet convinced is a great actor - is one hundred percent perfect in this role, to the extent that it would be a much poorer movie without the zeal and charisma which she brings to the titular Princess of the Amazons.Not a great film, but it is a good one.Not only is Wonder Woman an action film for all ages and genders, but it has a great positive message: no matter how ugly the world gets because of war and dictators, we must be good, protect one another and do right by one other.The superhero film is dripping with engaging characters and you find yourself engrossed with the story. But the film takes a sharp detour in its second half to unveil something incredibly formulaic and predictable.A triumph and the first truly great DC Films release, Wonder Woman exceeds every expectation and stands tall as one of the greatest superhero movies of all-time.Its brain, sense of spectacle, its excellent visual and its approach to an icon of popular culture place it as one of the best superhero movies since 'The Dark Knight' of Christopher Nolan.

       "4 At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar, after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995), is finally eating itself. At best, well, it's a superbly polished, technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?Funny, irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times.This is a charming and very memorable film.Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough.Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes.Of every Pixar film that deals with family, memory, and loss, ask, \"Is there sufficient reason for the tears that will inevitably run down my face by the end?\" Yes, thanks in no small part to the ingenious use of De La Cruz's hit song, \"Remember Me.\"It is gorgeous and stunning, but will also make sure that you will be ugly crying and calling your family members after the film credits start rolling.It is fun when this is the proposal, vibrant when it wants to be, and it hits us right in the heart when it decides it is time to make us cry. [Full Review in Spanish]It's not the best the studio has put out, but it's certainly the most emotionally wrought. It's almost hard to believe this is a movie for children.A fun, tender and bright adventure that, at the rhythm of 'Ranchera', excites and invites you to hold your tears as only the best films do. [Full Review in Spanish]Coco will tug at your heartstrings as it explores a culture often neglected, and a narrative that is incredibly important in the hopes of continuing the trend of cultural exploration ( ... ).The story's metaphysical slant lends the proceedings a haunting and ruminative air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "5 Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.Few films have stripped war down to its terrifying, thrilling essence as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, and few films have turned war into such an overwhelming, almost physical experience.Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.It isn't a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing.\"Virtual reality without the headset\", [Nolan] calls it, and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen.Occasional bursts of flames, imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters, come as a relief from the chromatic tedium.Nolan has managed to make a masterpiece in a genre crowded with masterpieces, one that will likely be held up as one of the best ever about World War II.[Dunkirk] is massive and impressive.Nolan's knack for 'sculpting in time' reaches a new apex. Dunkirk is to Nolan as 'David' is to Michelangelo. It's his masterpiece.From the artful cinematography to Hans Zimmer's disorienting score, and the non-linear narrative to the dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk is a practice in the bursting through the boundaries of filmmaking. But it's more than the craft. It has heart.The cinematography was exceptional with shots from above of a vast waterway and close up views of the beach, inside a ship, and the French shoreline.A perfect machine of a movie.

       "6 \"Star Wars\" is not \"Breaking Bad,\" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former.What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student, grappling with his failure in this new role, and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher.While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality, the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year...Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us, it's a tolerably good time.The devoted will no doubt be delighted; for the rest, a resigned acceptance may be the safest path to enjoyment.In a world bursting with flashy popcorn movies, there's still nothing quite like a \"Star Wars\" flick.I loved The Last Jedi. I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour.Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight.A superb addition to the Skywalker Saga which is sure to leave fans with plenty to talk - and argue - about, Star Wars: The Last Jedi now stands proudly alongside The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time.The Last Jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series.It is much less vibrant, and thus stands out the flaws of a script that wants to cross certain limits. [Full Review in Spanish]The performances are very interesting, thanks to a cast that may not be the most iconic, but it's one of the most competent of the franchise.

       "1 This movie lived up to its hype. It's possibly one of the best films of its kind, and I especially liked the development of all the characters. The villain isn't just a villain. I understood him. Like all Marvel films, the visual and aural elements are excellent. Acting and writing are top notch here as well. This film is a bit more serious than most Marvel films, which works in its favor.t was about time we saw a Marvel superhero blockbuster starring mostly African-American actors and achieving the success and popularity that it did - and even better is how great it is, with a thrilling climax and relatable characters that compensate for a couple of flaws in the script.When it comes to Marvel films, I put this one right up there as one of the best. It has a great villain, great visuals, great performances, and a great narrative that tests the morals of every character. Coogler does a great high-wire balancing act managing a complex story while staying true to the comics, introducing new characters into the MCU, and making a strong social statement. I also enjoyed the struggle between T'challa and Killmonger being portrayed as less of a hero vs villain and more of one ideology vs another, both with its merits and flaws. I only wish Killmonger's violence and evil streak was toned down a bit to show off his better intentions and humanize him more, but there's so much to enjoy here that it doesn't become a huge issue. Impressive visuals, characters, and storylines come together to form a great film here.With a superb soundtrack and great performances from Michael B Jordan and Danai Gurira, this, for me, is the most enjoyable Marvel movie yet.  With none of the forced humour it shows stronger storytelling instead which keeps you gripped until the end.\n",

       "1 \"Black Panther\" lived up to the hype.When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, \"Black Panther\" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender.Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times. And the final scene isn't the requisite pause before the next Marvel movie, but a genuine Moment. It's an emotionally rousing expression of why this movie matters, flaws and all.It's a powerful package.Black Panther is one of Marvel's best movies to date and Ryan Coogler has delivered something which is going to have a lasting impact not only on comic book fans but an entire generation. Wakanda Forever!Spectacular diversity magic! Black Panther slashes a lot of things, chiefly colonialism. In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him."

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Space Oddity\" is a song written and recorded by David Bowie. It was first released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of his second studio album, David Bowie. It became one of Bowie\\'s signature songs and one of four of his songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by Stanley Kubrick\\'s film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States\\' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later and would become the first manned moon landing another five days after that. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which was and still is an unmanned project. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and possibly the music video for \"Blackstar\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie\\'s first single to chart in the UK. It reached the top five on its initial release and received the 1970 Ivor Novello Special Award for Originality. His second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song became Bowie\\'s first UK No. 1 single.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1972, Mick Rock shot a video of Bowie miming to the June 1969 recording of the song, during the sessions for Aladdin Sane. The resulting music video was used to promote the 1973 US reissue of the \"Space Oddity\" single on RCA.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"The Pretender\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Foo Fighters. It was the first single from the group\\'s 2007 album Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace. It is one of Foo Fighters\\' most successful songs; only \"Learn to Fly\" and \"Best of You\" beat its position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2007 interview with XFM, frontman Dave Grohl stopped short of explaining the meaning behind \"The Pretender\", but alluded its roots go to current political unrest. Grohl noted,\\r\\n\"That\\'s the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it\\'s nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone\\'s been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they\\'re not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrohl also told XFM \"The Pretender\" was not initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\\r\\n\"That song didn\\'t happen until later on in the session. We didn\\'t go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn\\'t know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, \\'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,\\' and it just became everybody\\'s favorite song. ... It\\'s the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily. We put that song together in, I don\\'t know, a day, whereas a lot of the other songs we worked on for weeks.\"'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'\"Billie Jean\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer\\'s sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims to what the song\\'s lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline by guitarist David Williams, and Jackson\\'s vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \"Billie Jean\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwarded numerous honors—including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame—the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV\\'s racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson\\'s Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \"moonwalk\" also helped to popularize the song. It was also promoted through Jackson\\'s Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson\\'s scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \"Billie Jean\" sealed Jackson\\'s status as an international pop icon.\\r\\nJackson stated several times that \"Billie Jean\" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5. \"Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the \\'60s.\" He added: \"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that \"Billie Jean\" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic &amp; The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother\\'s dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.\\r\\nMichael Jackson wrote \"Billie Jean\" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: \"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That\\'s how I felt about \\'Billie Jean\\'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\" The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: \"The kid probably saved our lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson faced numerous disagreements with the song\\'s co-producer. It has been reported that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song\\'s bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson\\'s 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. \"I said, \\'Michael we\\'ve got to cut that intro\\'\" Jones later recalled. \"He said: \\'But that\\'s the jelly!\\'\\'That\\'s what makes me want to dance\\'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, \\'That\\'s what makes me want to dance\\', well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\" Jones also wanted to change the track\\'s title to \"Not My Lover\", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the demo tape sounded exactly like the finished product. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson\\'s entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, \"\\'Billie Jean\\' is hot on every level. It\\'s (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It\\'s hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It\\'s hot melodically  lyrically  vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times — unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: \"sonic personality\". \"What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat\" Swedien later wrote. \"The bottom line is that there aren\\'t many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is.\" He concluded, \"But I think that is the case with \\'Billie Jean\\' — and that I attribute to sonic personality.\"\\r\\n\"Billie Jean\" blends elements of post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson\\'s quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording “We Are the World,” Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for \"Billie Jean\" from a Hall &amp; Oates song (apparently referring to Hall\\'s \"I Can\\'t Go for That (No Can Do)\" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): \"Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn\\'t mind that he copied that groove.\" Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, \"it\\'s something we all do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson\\'s vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of \"Billie Jean\", the singer\\'s vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby\\'s eyes resemble Jackson\\'s, a voice laments, \"oh no\". This is met with Jackson\\'s signature falsetto \"hee hee\". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson\\'s vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean\\'s child.'</span></dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Insomnia\" is the title of a song recorded by British dance group Faithless. Released as the band\\'s second single, it became one of their most successful. It was released in 1995 and became a hit in Dance Charts while peaking at #27 in the UK in 1995 and #1 in 1996 . The song also reached #48 in the UK chart as a re-entry in 2005, showing the song\\'s longevity. The album version is nearly nine minutes long and contains some lyrics not able to be broadcast on the radio edit due to their explicit content. It also contains some bells chiming at the start of the song not generally known by the club-going public as many people know the Monster Mix or the Monster Mix Radio Edit. The Monster Mix was the mix featured on Faithless\\' greatest hits album Forever Faithless. The song topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. The Moody Mix featured on some of the singles was also on the Reverence / Irreverence release.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaithless have expressed their displeasure with the fact that elements of this song were reused by Sash! for his single \"Encore Une Fois\". Norwegian electronica artist Biosphere has claimed that Faithless sampled the bassline from his single \"Novelty Waves\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song is widely considered to be one of the best dance floor anthems of all time, and sparked off a new genre of music.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Schism\" is a song by American rock band Tool. It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, Lateralus. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.\\r\\n\"Schism\" was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Schism\" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times. The song begins with two bars of 5/4, followed by one bar of 4/4, followed by bars of alternating 5/8 and 7/8, until the first interlude, which consists of alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8.\\r\\nThe following verse exhibits a similar pattern to the first, alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8. The next section is bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. This takes the song back into alternating 5/8 and 7/8. Another 6/8 and 7/8 section follows, and after this the song goes into repeating 7/8 bars.\\r\\nThe middle section is subsequently introduced, consisting of three bars of 6/8, one bar of 3/8, and one bar of 3/4 repeating several times. At one point it interrupts with two bars of 6/8 followed by a bar of 4/8, twice. A bar of 5/8 is played before the meter switches back to 6/8 for two bars and 2/4 for one bar. This repeats, setting up another section: two bars of 9/8 followed by a bar of 10/8, that pattern again, and then a single bar of 9/8 followed by alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8. The outro has alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8, ending with alternating 6/8, 2/8 that one could interpret as pulsing with a 4/4 feel.\\r\\nThe band has referred to the time signature as 6.5/8. Although many composers would use 13/16 instead, 6.5/8 is still a valid fractional time signature.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'\"Karma Police\" is a song by English alternative rock band Radiohead from their 1997 third studio album OK Computer. The song\\'s title and lyrics derive from an in-joke among the band, referring to the Hindu theory of cause and effect, known as karma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Karma Police\" was released as the second single from OK Computer, and became a commercial success, charting at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number fourteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Critical reception to the single was also favourable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 the song was featured on the Radiohead: The Best Of collection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Karma Police\", like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on tour. A live version of \"Karma Police\", performed with a Rhodes piano on the Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Karma Police\" is in a 4/4 time signature and played in standard tuning. The first half of the song is in the key of E minor, and would feature a Neapolitan chord (F). The second half (starting with the line \"For a minute there\") is in B minor. Acoustic guitar and piano are the most prominent instruments in the song, and the chord progression owes an audible debt to The Beatles song \"Sexy Sadie\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of the song is unconventional in that it has nothing resembling a typical chorus. Instead, the song progresses from the intro into a mid-tempo section which alternates between two verses. The first verse begins with the line \"Karma police\", and the other begins with the line \"This is what you\\'ll get\". During the second section the drums drop out and an analog synthesizer imitating a choir is featured. After this section cycles through twice, the song switches into a second section which is based around the line \"For a minute there, I lost myself\". During this section of the song, Yorke\\'s voice is put through an echo effect and a sliding melodic figure serves as a counterpoint to Yorke\\'s vocals. In the outro, Ed O\\'Brien plays a few notes on his guitar, which are distorted by overloading an AMS rackmount digital delay unit and turning the delay rate knob down.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiohead members used to tell one another that they would call \"the karma police\" on them if they did something bad. The joke was incorporated into the lyrics and title of the song. Yorke explained that the song was about stress and \"having people looking at you in that certain  way, I can\\'t handle it anymore\". Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, \"It\\'s for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!\" Yorke and Jonny Greenwood emphasised in interviews that the song had a humorous bent; Yorke said, \" not entirely serious, I hope people will realize that.\" The song includes the line \"He buzzes like a fridge/He\\'s like a detuned radio\", a reference to the distracting, metaphorical background noise Yorke calls \"fridge buzz\". Yorke has said that the idea of fridge buzz is one of the primary themes of OK Computer. \"Karma Police\" also shares themes of insanity and dissatisfaction with capitalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jonathan Glazer, previously responsible for Radiohead\\'s \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" clip. The video premiered in August 1997 and featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke as well as Hungarian actor Lajos Kovács. Glazer won MTV\\'s Director of the Year award in 1997 for his work on this, as well as Jamiroquai\\'s \"Virtual Insanity\". Glazer however revealed in an interview that he considers this video to be a failed attempt. According to MTV.com, Glazer had pitched the concept of the \"Karma Police\" video months earlier to Marilyn Manson, who disliked it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video starts with the camera, an unseen driver, looking at the empty back seat of a 1976 Chrysler New Yorker at night. The \\'driver\\' then faces the windscreen and begins driving. For 35 seconds, it shows nothing but a road through grass illuminated by headlights, with insects visible around the windscreen. A figure is then seen running from the car. In time for the chorus the view shifts back to the back seat, where Thom Yorke now sits, almost mumbling his lyrics. The view yet again moves to the figure, who is close to being mown down, as the view again switches to Yorke, now slouching drowsily against the back of the front seat, barely lipsyncing any longer. The camera swivels again and the figure appears again, close this time. For the first time another perspective reveals the outside of the car. The pursued figure sharpens and is revealed to be a large man with a frightened look. The car comes to a stop before him, then reverses slightly, as if for a \\'run up\\', and this reveals it to be leaking fuel. The man realises the car has a petrol leak and puts his hands behind his back as if in resignation, then takes matches from his pocket, lights one, and throws it down. The perspective shifts to the car\\'s interior. The car suddenly reverses, away from the man, a path of fire now blazes back towards the car. The car slowly catches fire, and the camera/driver finally turns frantically to the back seat and robotically swivels back and forth, only to find that Yorke is no longer there.'</span></dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band\\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic.\\r\\nThe unexpected success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana\\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.\\r\\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics\\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Can\\'t Hold Us\" is a song by American rapper Macklemore and producer Ryan Lewis from their collaborative album The Heist (2012). Featuring singer Ray Dalton, it was released as the third single from the album on August 16, 2011. The song also features additional vocals by actress Susannah Wetzel, who sings portions of the chorus alongside Dalton.\\r\\nThe song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their second number-one hit in the United States. It is also their third consecutive number-one single in Australia.\\r\\nThe radio edit cuts out portions of the introduction, as well as the extended bridge section and an alternate beat during the last chorus, replacing them with an introduction from Dalton and a clapping beat. The beat is similar to their live performances of the song. The song is in the key of E minor with a tempo set at 146 beats per minute.\\r\\nMacklemore premiered the music video for \"Can\\'t Hold Us\" on April 17, 2013. The video was directed by Ryan Lewis, Jason Koenig &amp; Jon Jon Augustavo, and shooting took place for three months, on 2 continents and 16 different shoots, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to Southern California to New Zealand at Cathedral Cove where scenes for The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian were also shot. Several prominent parts were filmed on the tall ship Lady Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video won two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Hip-Hop Video and Best Cinematography, and was nominated for Best Direction and Best Editing. It also was place at No. 12 on BET Notarized Top 100 in 2013. It was nominated for Best Music Video at the 2014 Grammy Awards.\\r\\nIn May 2012, the song was re-released and featured in an International TV commercial for Miller Genuine Draft, created by the advertising agency me&amp;lewis ideas. In early 2013, the song was used in a U.S. television commercial for Microsoft\\'s Outlook.com webmail service. The song was also used in the background of ESPN College GameDay commercials, the March 2013 premiere episode of MTV\\'s The Real World: Portland, in commercials for the movie R.I.P.D. and in the trailer for the film Grudge Match. It is featured on the soundtrack for the 2013 film on Steve Jobs titled Jobs and the American basketball video game NBA 2K14. On July 2, 2013, mash-up artist DJ Earworm released a summer mash-up, incorporating \"Can\\'t Hold Us\" with 10 other songs that became popular in summer 2013. In late 2013, the chorus from the song was used in an ad campaign for the opening of the Graton Resort &amp; Casino in Northern California. The song was also used in YouTube\\'s annual Rewind video. The songs segment in the video features YouTube stars, The Slow Mo Guys.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'Initially issued as a 7\" vinyl single on 27 October 1980 as a preview to the album Ace of Spades and autumn tour, Bronze Records also released a 12\" vinyl pressing in special Christmas picture sleeves, limited to 50,000 copies. The picture of the band in Santa outfits used on the cover was taken at the Aylesbury Fair, while the band were on tour.\\r\\nBronze also issued German and Spanish 7\" vinyl versions which had a different sleeves, as well as a Japanese release, with a colour picture insert with song lyrics in English and Japanese. One sided test pressings (not mis-presses, but used in the trade) escaped the pressing plant and are on the market.\\r\\nThe song opens with an overdriven bass solo played by Lemmy. For the lyrics, he said he \"used gambling metaphors, mostly cards and dice – when it comes to that sort of thing, I\\'m more into the one-arm bandits actually, but you can\\'t really sing about spinning fruit, and the wheels coming down\".\\r\\nOn 6 September 1980 Lemmy was interviewed by Graham Neale on BBC Radio 1\\'s Rock On Saturday show, \"Bomber\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Love Me Like a Reptile\" were played. The following month, on 6 and 20 October, the band played the song on BBC TV show Top of the Pops.\\r\\nIn the studio version, the last lines of the bridge are \"I don\\'t want to live forever/And don\\'t forget the Joker\". In the live versions and the Rock Band 2 remake, the last lines are \"I don\\'t want to live forever/But, apparently I am\".'</dd>\n",

He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, passers-by then repeatedly bump into him (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of The Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'\"Bring Me to Life\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \"Bring Me to Life\" in 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence\\'s debut studio album, Fallen. The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist\\'s life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee\\'s vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp Stölzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bring Me to Life\" was directed by Philipp Stölzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, Stölzl said: \"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul\\'s arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.'</span></dd>\n",

The song was voted by Mixmag readers as the third greatest dance record of all time. Although the song wasn\\'t as big a commercial success as their previous singles, it gained a cult following.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song caused considerable controversy because of its allegedly misogynistic title and its video, which depicted scenes of drunken and drug-fuelled sexual excess and violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the release of the single, Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Call Me Maybe\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) and appearing on her international debut album, Kiss. The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on 20 September 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \"Call Me Maybe\" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content. \"Call Me Maybe\" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders &amp; Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position in Canada, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007\\'s \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne. With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, \"Call Me Maybe\" is one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, the singer has performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. \"Call Me Maybe\" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil\\' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Nickelback, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, Glee and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on the season premiere episode, \"The New Rachel\", of the fourth season of Glee. The song used in in other television shows, Castle, Jane by Design, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and 90210.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call Me Maybe\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, which will be held on 10 February 2013. On 11 December 2012, \"Call Me Maybe\" was named Song of the Year of 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard Magazine ranked this song #2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 Songs charts, in each case behind \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice\\'s annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling 10 million copies in that year alone, and best-selling single in iTunes Store in 2012.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"I\\'m Yours\" is the first single released by American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz from his third studio album We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. (2008) The song was originally released on a limited edition EP called Extra Credit as a demo in 2005 to promote his second studio album Mr. A–Z. It was performed in his 2004 and 2005 gigs and already became a crowd favorite before its release. \"I\\'m Yours\" was nominated for Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards. It was also used for the Australian Seven Network\\'s promotion of the season premiere of Packed to the Rafters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m Yours\" was immensely successful in the US on the Billboard charts. At 76 weeks on the Hot 100, it held the record for most weeks spent on the chart, breaking the previous record of 69 weeks set by LeAnn Rimes\\' song \"How Do I Live\" in 1998; this record has since been broken by Imagine Dragons\\' \"Radioactive\", which spent 87 weeks on the chart, and AWOLNATION\\'s \"Sail\", which spent 79 weeks on the chart. As of January 2013, it is the tenth best-selling digital song of all time in the US, selling over 6 million downloads, and 12.2 million worldwide. It remains Mraz\\'s biggest US hit single to date. The song was used as an \\'inspiration\\' for the Bollywood movie Nautanki Saala song \"Mera Mann Kehne Laga\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMraz first launched the song from the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, at Michele Clark\\'s Sunset Sessions in 2008. He also sang a version on Sesame Street titled \"Outdoors\" and released a successful remixed version featuring Lil Wayne and Jah Cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nComposition\\r\\nAccording to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of C major (recorded a half-step lower in B major). The majority of the song contains the I-V-vi-IV progression.\\r\\n\\r\\nChart performance\\r\\nThroughout 2008, \"I\\'m Yours\" slowly increased in airplay and digital sales and would go on to become Mraz\\'s biggest hit to date, charting higher than his previous pop hit, 2003\\'s \"The Remedy (I Won\\'t Worry)\". It became his first top ten single in the US, peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Pop 100. On the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart the song was number one for a total of nine weeks. The single later received Mainstream Top 40 airplay, eventually topping that chart as well. Due to its gradually building crossover appeal, the song has had extremely unusual longevity, not reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40 until December 2008, ten months after its release and seven months after it debuted on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. In fact, VH1 had already retired the song in early October 2008 after a 20-week run. The song returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 for the third time in its 38th week on the chart. \"I\\'m Yours\" would go on to chart for a total of 76 weeks, making this the longest chart run in Billboard magazine history, up until the 87-week run of Imagine Dragons\\' \"Radioactive\" and the 79-week run of AWOLNATION\\'s \"Sail\", both set in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year into its release, it topped another chart for the first time, when it hit number one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks during the week of February 5, 2009. This marked 11 months since the song had topped its first chart in the US, when it reached number one on the Triple A chart in March 2008. \"I\\'m Yours\" spent 16 weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, after topping the Adult Contemporary chart, \"I\\'m Yours\" became the first song to top the Triple A, Adult Top 40, Mainstream Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts. Despite weak initial download sales, it became the eighth best-selling digital song in the United States by January 2012. It has sold 6,837,000 copies in the US as of April 23, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is Mraz\\'s most successful global single to date, reaching number one in Sweden and Norway, and the top ten in Canada, United States, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It was also able to reach number one on the Top 40 Digital Track Chart in Australia. In Hawaii, radio stations do play the original version, along with a Hawaiian remix of the song. \"I\\'m Yours\" has also been a huge hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number one, knocking off \"Poker Face\" which spent ten consecutive weeks at number one. It was certified Gold after nine weeks selling over 7,500 copies and then certified Platinum after 14 weeks selling over 15,000 copies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m Yours\" made its debut on the British singles chart on December 12, 2008, at number 78 and then slowly climbed up the chart until it peaked at number 11. It spent the whole of 2009 on the chart apart from the final two weeks of the year, then re-entered in January 2010 and again in August, and has now clocked up 56 weeks on the official UK Top 75, making it currently the 15th longest runner of all time and the longest never to make the Top 10, at 84 weeks on the Top 100.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Creep\" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. Radiohead released \"Creep\" as their debut single in 1992, and it later appeared on their first album, Pablo Honey (1993). During its initial release, \"Creep\" was not a chart success. However, upon re-release in 1993, it became a worldwide hit. Attendees of Radiohead\\'s early gigs often exhibited little interest in the band\\'s other songs, causing the band to react against \"Creep\" and play it less often during the mid-to-late 1990s. It is included in the Radiohead: The Best Of compilation album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artwork for the single is a painting by Maurice Burns, called \"Craigavon Under Age Drinkers Rule\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, Thom Yorke wrote \"Creep\" while studying at Exeter University in the late 1980s. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said that the song was inspired by a girl that Yorke had followed around who showed up unexpectedly during a show by the band.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, during rehearsal sessions with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, Radiohead spontaneously performed \"Creep\". Yorke described \"Creep\" to the producers as \"our Scott Walker song\"; Slade and Kolderie mistook the singer\\'s remark and believed the song was a cover. After tension arose due to unsatisfactory attempts at recording other songs, Slade and Kolderie tried to improve morale by requesting Radiohead to play \"Creep\" again. The band recorded the song in a single take; after the performance everyone in the room burst into applause. Once the band assured Kolderie that \"Creep\" was an original song, he called EMI to tell them to consider the song as Radiohead\\'s next single. While the recording had minimal overdubs and the band did not intend to release it, the producers were impressed with the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to similarities to \"The Air That I Breathe\", a song recorded by the Hollies in 1973, Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood are credited as co-writers of \"Creep\". \"Creep\" uses a chord progression used in \"The Air That I Breathe\" in its verse and a melody from \"The Air That I Breathe\" in the bridge following the second chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe G–B–C–Cm chord progression is repeated throughout the whole song, just alternating between arpeggiated chords in the verses and last chorus and loud power chords during the first two choruses. In G major, these may be interpreted as \"I–III–IV–iv\". According to Guy Capuzzo, the ostinato musically portrays \"the song\\'s obsessive lyrics, which depict the \\'self-lacerating rage of an unsuccessful crush\\'.\" For example, the \"highest pitches of the ostinato form a prominent chromatic line that \\'creeps\\' up, then down, involving scale degrees {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {5}}} \\\\hat 5– ♯ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {5}}} \\\\hat 5– {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {6}}} \\\\hat 6– ♭ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {6}}} \\\\hat 6.... ascend, the lyrics strain towards optimism...descend, the subject sinks back into the throes of self-pity...The guitarist\\'s fretting hand mirrors this contour\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the song shifts from the verse to the chorus, Jonny Greenwood plays three blasts of guitar noise (\"dead notes\" played by releasing fret-hand pressure and picking the strings). Greenwood said he did this because he did not like how quiet the song was; he explained: \"So I hit the guitar hard—really hard\". Ed O\\'Brien said: \"That\\'s the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn\\'t like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song.\" During the song\\'s outro, Jonny Greenwood plays a piano figure. Kolderie forgot to add the piano part during the final mix until the end of the song, but the band approved of the final result.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Yorke, \"Creep\" tells the tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the attention of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about \"Creep\" in 1993, Yorke said: \"I have a real problem being a man in the \\'90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you\\'re in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it\\'s not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I\\'m always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it.\" Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about \"recognizing what you are\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe version issued for US radio play replaced the line \"So fucking special\" with \"So very special\". The group was worried that issuing a censored version would be a \"bit of a sellout\" according to Jonny Greenwood, but they decided it was acceptable since their idols Sonic Youth had done the same thing. Nonetheless, Greenwood noted the British press \"weren\\'t impressed\" by the action. During the recording session for the censored lyrics, Kolderie convinced Yorke to rewrite the first verse, telling him he thought the singer could do better.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Feel Good Inc.\" is an alternative rock song by British virtual band Gorillaz. The song features rap verses by De La Soul and showcases the band\\'s alternative hip hop influences, while also containing elements of drum and bass and funk rock. The lyrical themes of the song revolve around isolation and escapism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was the lead single from the band\\'s second studio album Demon Days on 9 May 2005. The single peaked at No. 2 in the United Kingdom and No. 14 in the United States, the band\\'s highest chart positions to date. It also topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks, a first for the band. This is the only song in Damon Albarn\\'s career to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked in the top 10 in 17 countries, reaching No. 1 in Spain. The song was listed in Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone\\'s Best Songs of the 2000s. The song won Best Pop Collaboration at the 2006 Grammy Awards. In an interview during promotion for The Singles Collection 2001–2011, Murdoc described it as \"the song that launched a million iPods\" and \" first song ever to chart on downloads alone, infamous soundtrack to the iPod advert, Grammy award winner, backing track for Madonna\\'s first holographic poledance.\" This song has surpassed \"Clint Eastwood\" to be Gorillaz\\'s most successful single worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview from Gorillaz\\' \"iTunes Session\" in 2010, band member 2D states that the inspiration for the song came from the time he was \"passing the wind turbines out near Palm Springs. He believed he was going to the Coachella festival or something, and he passed a huge field full of those wind turbines farming the land ... so he started really with the chorus section and then built it up from there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the video, while the camera is rising up from the Feel Good Inc. tower, a sample of the Spacemonkeyz dub of \"Clint Eastwood\" entitled \"A Fistful of Peanuts\" can be heard. The main themes of the video are intellectual freedom and the media\\'s dumbing down of mass culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the video, 2D yearns for the freedom to join Noodle on her floating island. The characters lying on the floor represent those who have already been \"dumbed down\", while the band members are the ones who have awakened. 2D is trying to wake all the people from their half-dead state by yelling at them through his megaphone, in the style of a political activist. Jamie Hewlett said in an interview that the inspiration for some scenes in the video came from Hayao Miyazaki; specifically, the windmill-powered landmass, which has been compared to that of Miyazaki\\'s Castle in the Sky. The floating island is chased by ominous helicopters, which closely resemble Korean War era Bell H-13s, monitoring the behaviour inside and ensuring that no one escapes. It is unclear whether they are preventing Noodle\\'s escape or are chasing her away. Back in the tower, De La Soul appear as larger-than life, seemingly omnipotent images on surrounding television screens, laughing at the Gorillaz band members. Their taunting drives 2D into a wild, hypnotic frenzy as he tries to resist the urge to be dumbed down. At the end of the video, 2D appears beaten by his surroundings, and returns to the state he was in when the video began, repeating the words \"Feel good\" until the video finally ends, in an exact reversal of the intro. The repetition of \"Feel good\" represents that 2D is convincing himself that everything is OK (as if he is brainwashing himself to believe it), instead of facing the harsh truth of the situation. The music video for \"El Mañana\" is a continuation of this video, depicting two helicopter gunships catching up to Noodle\\'s floating windmill island and attacking it.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Empire State of Mind\" is a song by American rapper Jay-Z, featuring vocals and a chorus from American singer Alicia Keys. It was released as the third single from Jay-Z\\'s 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009), by his Roc Nation label in October 2009. The song is an anthemic ode to both artists\\' native New York, and features a music sample of \"Love on a Two-Way Street\" (1970), written by Sylvia Robinson and Bert Keyes and performed by The Moments. \"Empire State of Mind\" was originally written by Brooklyn natives Angela Hunte and Jane\\'t \"Jnay\" Sewell-Ulepic who were feeling homesick while on an overseas trip in February 2009. The following month they sent the song in for consideration at Roc Nation, although it received negative reviews. Initially discouraged, the duo sent the song to Jay-Z after a suggestion by an associate of EMI Music Publishing (EMI), and after an incident which they described as an omen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hearing the song, Jay-Z immediately recorded it, changing all of the verses but keeping the hook. The single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song\\'s hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song\\'s piano loop. The song was viewed as being an \"orchestral rap ballad\" and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to drugs, locations in New York and its famous residents, and describes the city\\'s essence. Profanity is also present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was included in multiple critics\\' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times. The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. \"Empire State of Mind\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including; the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Italy and Sweden. The single was commercially successful in the United States, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Jay-Z\\'s first number-one single on the chart as a lead artist. It appeared in 2009 year-end charts in Italy, Australia and the US. The song is also the last number one hit of the 2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the song\\'s music video, which is primarily in black-and-white, Jay-Z and Keys are shown performing the song in various locations in New York. \"Empire State of Mind\" has been performed by Jay-Z and Keys multiple times, including during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2009 American Music Awards. Usually when the duo performs the song, an overhead screen shows images of places in New York. Keys has recorded a sequel entitled \"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\", which is featured on her fourth studio album The Element of Freedom (2009). Her version was positively received by critics and did well commercially, but was not as successful as its predecessor, but it was Top 10 in three countries in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. She said that she chose to record her own version of \"Empire State of Mind\" because she wanted to express her own personal feelings about New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single has sold 5 million copies to date.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Fix You\" is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was written by all four members of the band for their third album, X&amp;Y. The track is built around an organ, that is accompanied by slow tempo drums, and a vocals. It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&amp;Y and has reached number four in the United Kingdom Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US.\\r\\nBlythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\\'s mother-in-law, stated in an interview in May 2012 that Chris Martin \\'wrote the song Fix You for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it\\'.\\r\\n\"Fix You\" received positive reviews. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The song, itself, was nominated for multiple awards in the categories of Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Anthem of the Summer. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\\r\\nThe guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League\\'s Montreal Canadiens\\' home games.\\r\\nThe song was played live to a motionless crowd at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, CA.\\r\\n\"Fix You\" covered by Boyce Avenue was used in the video \"Internet Love Story: CTFxC Wedding (Charles &amp; Alli)\" uploaded by user charlestrippy on 22 November 2011. As of 27 April 2012 it currently has 2,330,161 views.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band\\'s first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete. In the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of X&amp;Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King\\'s Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin\\'s walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song\\'s finale. The audience sings along with the song\\'s final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Take Me to Church\" is a song by Irish musician Hozier for his debut extended play (EP) Take Me to Church (2013), as well as his self-titled debut album (2014). The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents\\' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier\\'s frustration with the Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. It first caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track, Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"Magic\" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay for their sixth studio album, Ghost Stories (2014). It was written and produced by band members Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, Chris Martin, with production assistance from Paul Epworth, Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson. The song was released as the lead single from Ghost Stories on 3 March 2014, by Parlophone. A beat consisting of a \"muffled snare\" and \"dusty bass riff\" is repeated throughout most of the song. As the song progresses, an organ is later added to the instrumentation which is eventually swapped out for a stomp-clap beat and again for a synth beat. Following the song\\'s second chorus, these beats are gradually combined together while Martin sings in falsetto. The song\\'s \"anticlimactic\" portion then decreases intensity until it has eventually resumed to simply a snare and bass riff.\\r\\nThe song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London, England, both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008\\'s Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011\\'s Mylo Xyloto respectively. The song\\'s bass riff, the first part of the song, was originally conceived by Guy Berryman during the band\\'s recording sessions in February 2013. The song was then covered by singer/songwriter Lauren Aquilina for her BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session.'</dd>\n",

       "\t\t<dd>'\"We Can\\'t Stop\" is a song by American recording artist Miley Cyrus for her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). It was released on June 3, 2013 by RCA Records as the lead single from the album, following Cyrus\\' departure from Hollywood Records in early 2013. \"We Can\\'t Stop\" was written by Mike L. Williams II, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Timothy Thomas and Theron Thomas (known collectively as Rock City), Cyrus, Douglas Davis and Ricky Walters. The song was produced by Williams II under his production name, Mike Will Made-It, with co-production from P-Nasty and vocal production by Rock City. \"We Can\\'t Stop\" is a pop, R&amp;B, and dance song that lyrically talks of a house party.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its release, \"We Can\\'t Stop\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and lyrics. It peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. In doing so, it tied Cyrus\\' earlier song \"Party in the U.S.A.\" as her highest-peaking track in the country, where it has exceeded sales of two million copies. Internationally, the track enjoyed similar success, topping national singles charts in territories including New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Diane Martel and was released on June 19, 2013. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on Cyrus\\' increasingly provocative image. Thirty-seven days after its premiere, it became the fastest clip to reach 100 million views across Vevo platforms. \"We Can\\'t Stop\" was additionally promoted with a highly-controversial performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased on June 19, 2013, and directed by Diane Martel, the video portrays Cyrus and her friends at a house party and, according to her, is inspired by true events. The video starts with Miley cutting off a house-arrest ankle bracelet and putting on gold teeth accessories. It also shows Cyrus making out with a doll of herself in a pool, doing her infamous \"twerking\", dancing with a giant teddy bear; and other bizarre scenes, such as a skull made out of french fries, cutting off fake fingers in the kitchen, a mountain of bread, a computer-animated mask, and smoke coming out of a man\\'s crotch. The video shows vibrant colors. This aspect of Cyrus\\' video was praised by critics, along with its creativity. The Director\\'s Cut version has new scenes of Cyrus that weren\\'t seen on the original video, such as the singing karaoke scenes.'</dd>\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Space Oddity\" is a song written and recorded by David Bowie. It was first released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of his second studio album, David Bowie. It became one of Bowie\\textbackslash{}'s signature songs and one of four of his songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\textbackslash{}'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nInspired by Stanley Kubrick\\textbackslash{}'s film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States\\textbackslash{}' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later and would become the first manned moon landing another five days after that. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which was and still is an unmanned project. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and possibly the music video for \"Blackstar\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie\\textbackslash{}'s first single to chart in the UK. It reached the top five on its initial release and received the 1970 Ivor Novello Special Award for Originality. His second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song became Bowie\\textbackslash{}'s first UK No. 1 single.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn December 1972, Mick Rock shot a video of Bowie miming to the June 1969 recording of the song, during the sessions for Aladdin Sane. The resulting music video was used to promote the 1973 US reissue of the \"Space Oddity\" single on RCA.'\n",

Grohl noted,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"That\\textbackslash{}'s the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it\\textbackslash{}'s nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone\\textbackslash{}'s been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they\\textbackslash{}'re not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGrohl also told XFM \"The Pretender\" was not initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"That song didn\\textbackslash{}'t happen until later on in the session. We didn\\textbackslash{}'t go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn\\textbackslash{}'t know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, \\textbackslash{}'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,\\textbackslash{}' and it just became everybody\\textbackslash{}'s favorite song. ... It\\textbackslash{}'s the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily.

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Billie Jean\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer\\textbackslash{}'s sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims to what the song\\textbackslash{}'s lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline by guitarist David Williams, and Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \"Billie Jean\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAwarded numerous honors—including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame—the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV\\textbackslash{}'s racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \"moonwalk\" also helped to popularize the song. It was also promoted through Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \"Billie Jean\" sealed Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s status as an international pop icon.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJackson stated several times that \"Billie Jean\" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5. \"Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the \\textbackslash{}'60s.\" He added: \"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that \"Billie Jean\" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic \\& The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFollowing the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother\\textbackslash{}'s dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichael Jackson wrote \"Billie Jean\" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: \"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That\\textbackslash{}'s how I felt about \\textbackslash{}'Billie Jean\\textbackslash{}'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\" The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: \"The kid probably saved our lives.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJackson faced numerous disagreements with the song\\textbackslash{}'s co-producer. It has been reported that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song\\textbackslash{}'s bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. \"I said, \\textbackslash{}'Michael we\\textbackslash{}'ve got to cut that intro\\textbackslash{}'\" Jones later recalled. \"He said: \\textbackslash{}'But that\\textbackslash{}'s the jelly!\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}'That\\textbackslash{}'s what makes me want to dance\\textbackslash{}'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, \\textbackslash{}'That\\textbackslash{}'s what makes me want to dance\\textbackslash{}', well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\" Jones also wanted to change the track\\textbackslash{}'s title to \"Not My Lover\", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the demo tape sounded exactly like the finished product. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHaving resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, \"\\textbackslash{}'Billie Jean\\textbackslash{}' is hot on every level. It\\textbackslash{}'s (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It\\textbackslash{}'s hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It\\textbackslash{}'s hot melodically  lyrically  vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times — unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: \"sonic personality\". \"What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat\" Swedien later wrote. \"The bottom line is that there aren\\textbackslash{}'t many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is.\" He concluded, \"But I think that is the case with \\textbackslash{}'Billie Jean\\textbackslash{}' — and that I attribute to sonic personality.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Billie Jean\" blends elements of post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAccording to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording “We Are the World,” Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for \"Billie Jean\" from a Hall \\& Oates song (apparently referring to Hall\\textbackslash{}'s \"I Can\\textbackslash{}'t Go for That (No Can Do)\" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): \"Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn\\textbackslash{}'t mind that he copied that groove.\" Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, \"it\\textbackslash{}'s something we all do.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAccording to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of \"Billie Jean\", the singer\\textbackslash{}'s vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby\\textbackslash{}'s eyes resemble Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s, a voice laments, \"oh no\". This is met with Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s signature falsetto \"hee hee\". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean\\textbackslash{}'s child.'\n",

Released as the band\\textbackslash{}'s second single, it became one of their most successful. It was released in 1995 and became a hit in Dance Charts while peaking at \\#27 in the UK in 1995 and \\#1 in 1996 . The song also reached \\#48 in the UK chart as a re-entry in 2005, showing the song\\textbackslash{}'s longevity. The album version is nearly nine minutes long and contains some lyrics not able to be broadcast on the radio edit due to their explicit content. It also contains some bells chiming at the start of the song not generally known by the club-going public as many people know the Monster Mix or the Monster Mix Radio Edit. The Monster Mix was the mix featured on Faithless\\textbackslash{}' greatest hits album Forever Faithless. The song topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. The Moody Mix featured on some of the singles was also on the Reverence / Irreverence release.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFaithless have expressed their displeasure with the fact that elements of this song were reused by Sash! for his single \"Encore Une Fois\". Norwegian electronica artist Biosphere has claimed that Faithless sampled the bassline from his single \"Novelty Waves\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song is widely considered to be one of the best dance floor anthems of all time, and sparked off a new genre of music.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Schism\" is a song by American rock band Tool. It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, Lateralus. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Schism\" was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Schism\" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times. The song begins with two bars of 5/4, followed by one bar of 4/4, followed by bars of alternating 5/8 and 7/8, until the first interlude, which consists of alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe following verse exhibits a similar pattern to the first, alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8. The next section is bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. This takes the song back into alternating 5/8 and 7/8. Another 6/8 and 7/8 section follows, and after this the song goes into repeating 7/8 bars.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe middle section is subsequently introduced, consisting of three bars of 6/8, one bar of 3/8, and one bar of 3/4 repeating several times. At one point it interrupts with two bars of 6/8 followed by a bar of 4/8, twice. A bar of 5/8 is played before the meter switches back to 6/8 for two bars and 2/4 for one bar. This repeats, setting up another section: two bars of 9/8 followed by a bar of 10/8, that pattern again, and then a single bar of 9/8 followed by alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8. The outro has alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8, ending with alternating 6/8, 2/8 that one could interpret as pulsing with a 4/4 feel.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe band has referred to the time signature as 6.5/8. Although many composers would use 13/16 instead, 6.5/8 is still a valid fractional time signature.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Karma Police\" is a song by English alternative rock band Radiohead from their 1997 third studio album OK Computer. The song\\textbackslash{}'s title and lyrics derive from an in-joke among the band, referring to the Hindu theory of cause and effect, known as karma.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Karma Police\" was released as the second single from OK Computer, and became a commercial success, charting at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number fourteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Critical reception to the single was also favourable.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn 2008 the song was featured on the Radiohead: The Best Of collection.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Karma Police\", like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on tour. A live version of \"Karma Police\", performed with a Rhodes piano on the Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Karma Police\" is in a 4/4 time signature and played in standard tuning. The first half of the song is in the key of E minor, and would feature a Neapolitan chord (F). The second half (starting with the line \"For a minute there\") is in B minor. Acoustic guitar and piano are the most prominent instruments in the song, and the chord progression owes an audible debt to The Beatles song \"Sexy Sadie\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe structure of the song is unconventional in that it has nothing resembling a typical chorus. Instead, the song progresses from the intro into a mid-tempo section which alternates between two verses. The first verse begins with the line \"Karma police\", and the other begins with the line \"This is what you\\textbackslash{}'ll get\". During the second section the drums drop out and an analog synthesizer imitating a choir is featured. After this section cycles through twice, the song switches into a second section which is based around the line \"For a minute there, I lost myself\". During this section of the song, Yorke\\textbackslash{}'s voice is put through an echo effect and a sliding melodic figure serves as a counterpoint to Yorke\\textbackslash{}'s vocals. In the outro, Ed O\\textbackslash{}'Brien plays a few notes on his guitar, which are distorted by overloading an AMS rackmount digital delay unit and turning the delay rate knob down.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRadiohead members used to tell one another that they would call \"the karma police\" on them if they did something bad. The joke was incorporated into the lyrics and title of the song. Yorke explained that the song was about stress and \"having people looking at you in that certain  way, I can\\textbackslash{}'t handle it anymore\". Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, \"It\\textbackslash{}'s for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!\" Yorke and Jonny Greenwood emphasised in interviews that the song had a humorous bent; Yorke said, \" not entirely serious, I hope people will realize that.\" The song includes the line \"He buzzes like a fridge/He\\textbackslash{}'s like a detuned radio\", a reference to the distracting, metaphorical background noise Yorke calls \"fridge buzz\". Yorke has said that the idea of fridge buzz is one of the primary themes of OK Computer. \"Karma Police\" also shares themes of insanity and dissatisfaction with capitalism.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe music video for the song was directed by Jonathan Glazer, previously responsible for Radiohead\\textbackslash{}'s \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" clip. The video premiered in August 1997 and featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke as well as Hungarian actor Lajos Kovács. Glazer won MTV\\textbackslash{}'s Director of the Year award in 1997 for his work on this, as well as Jamiroquai\\textbackslash{}'s \"Virtual Insanity\". Glazer however revealed in an interview that he considers this video to be a failed attempt. According to MTV.com, Glazer had pitched the concept of the \"Karma Police\" video months earlier to Marilyn Manson, who disliked it.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe video starts with the camera, an unseen driver, looking at the empty back seat of a 1976 Chrysler New Yorker at night. The \\textbackslash{}'driver\\textbackslash{}' then faces the windscreen and begins driving. For 35 seconds, it shows nothing but a road through grass illuminated by headlights, with insects visible around the windscreen. A figure is then seen running from the car. In time for the chorus the view shifts back to the back seat, where Thom Yorke now sits, almost mumbling his lyrics. The view yet again moves to the figure, who is close to being mown down, as the view again switches to Yorke, now slouching drowsily against the back of the front seat, barely lipsyncing any longer. The camera swivels again and the figure appears again, close this time. For the first time another perspective reveals the outside of the car. The pursued figure sharpens and is revealed to be a large man with a frightened look. The car comes to a stop before him, then reverses slightly, as if for a \\textbackslash{}'run up\\textbackslash{}', and this reveals it to be leaking fuel. The man realises the car has a petrol leak and puts his hands behind his back as if in resignation, then takes matches from his pocket, lights one, and throws it down. The perspective shifts to the car\\textbackslash{}'s interior. The car suddenly reverses, away from the man, a path of fire now blazes back towards the car. The car slowly catches fire, and the camera/driver finally turns frantically to the back seat and robotically swivels back and forth, only to find that Yorke is no longer there.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band\\textbackslash{}'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe unexpected success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana\\textbackslash{}'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz \\& Jop critics\\textbackslash{}' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\\textbackslash{}'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Can\\textbackslash{}'t Hold Us\" is a song by American rapper Macklemore and producer Ryan Lewis from their collaborative album The Heist (2012). Featuring singer Ray Dalton, it was released as the third single from the album on August 16, 2011. The song also features additional vocals by actress Susannah Wetzel, who sings portions of the chorus alongside Dalton.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their second number-one hit in the United States. It is also their third consecutive number-one single in Australia.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe radio edit cuts out portions of the introduction, as well as the extended bridge section and an alternate beat during the last chorus, replacing them with an introduction from Dalton and a clapping beat. The beat is similar to their live performances of the song. The song is in the key of E minor with a tempo set at 146 beats per minute.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMacklemore premiered the music video for \"Can\\textbackslash{}'t Hold Us\" on April 17, 2013. The video was directed by Ryan Lewis, Jason Koenig \\& Jon Jon Augustavo, and shooting took place for three months, on 2 continents and 16 different shoots, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to Southern California to New Zealand at Cathedral Cove where scenes for The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian were also shot. Several prominent parts were filmed on the tall ship Lady Washington.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe video won two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Hip-Hop Video and Best Cinematography, and was nominated for Best Direction and Best Editing. It also was place at No. 12 on BET Notarized Top 100 in 2013. It was nominated for Best Music Video at the 2014 Grammy Awards.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn May 2012, the song was re-released and featured in an International TV commercial for Miller Genuine Draft, created by the advertising agency me\\&lewis ideas. In early 2013, the song was used in a U.S. television commercial for Microsoft\\textbackslash{}'s Outlook.com webmail service. The song was also used in the background of ESPN College GameDay commercials, the March 2013 premiere episode of MTV\\textbackslash{}'s The Real World: Portland, in commercials for the movie R.I.P.D. and in the trailer for the film Grudge Match. It is featured on the soundtrack for the 2013 film on Steve Jobs titled Jobs and the American basketball video game NBA 2K14. On July 2, 2013, mash-up artist DJ Earworm released a summer mash-up, incorporating \"Can\\textbackslash{}'t Hold Us\" with 10 other songs that became popular in summer 2013. In late 2013, the chorus from the song was used in an ad campaign for the opening of the Graton Resort \\& Casino in Northern California. The song was also used in YouTube\\textbackslash{}'s annual Rewind video. The songs segment in the video features YouTube stars, The Slow Mo Guys.'\n",

He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, passers-by then repeatedly bump into him (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of The Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Bring Me to Life\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \"Bring Me to Life\" in 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence\\textbackslash{}'s debut studio album, Fallen. The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAccording to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist\\textbackslash{}'s life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee\\textbackslash{}'s vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFollowing the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp Stölzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe accompanying music video for \"Bring Me to Life\" was directed by Philipp Stölzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, Stölzl said: \"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul\\textbackslash{}'s arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Smack My Bitch Up\" is a song by British big beat group the Prodigy. It was released in November 1997 as the third and final single from the album The Fat of the Land. The song was voted by Mixmag readers as the third greatest dance record of all time. Although the song wasn\\textbackslash{}'t as big a commercial success as their previous singles, it gained a cult following.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song caused considerable controversy because of its allegedly misogynistic title and its video, which depicted scenes of drunken and drug-fuelled sexual excess and violence.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nPrior to the release of the single, Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Call Me Maybe\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) and appearing on her international debut album, Kiss. The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on 20 September 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \"Call Me Maybe\" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content. \"Call Me Maybe\" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders \\& Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position in Canada, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007\\textbackslash{}'s \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne. With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, \"Call Me Maybe\" is one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, the singer has performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. \"Call Me Maybe\" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil\\textbackslash{}' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Nickelback, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, Glee and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on the season premiere episode, \"The New Rachel\", of the fourth season of Glee. The song used in in other television shows, Castle, Jane by Design, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and 90210.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Call Me Maybe\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, which will be held on 10 February 2013. On 11 December 2012, \"Call Me Maybe\" was named Song of the Year of 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard Magazine ranked this song \\#2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 Songs charts, in each case behind \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice\\textbackslash{}'s annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling 10 million copies in that year alone, and best-selling single in iTunes Store in 2012.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" is the first single released by American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz from his third studio album We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. (2008) The song was originally released on a limited edition EP called Extra Credit as a demo in 2005 to promote his second studio album Mr. A–Z. It was performed in his 2004 and 2005 gigs and already became a crowd favorite before its release. \"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" was nominated for Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards. It was also used for the Australian Seven Network\\textbackslash{}'s promotion of the season premiere of Packed to the Rafters.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" was immensely successful in the US on the Billboard charts. At 76 weeks on the Hot 100, it held the record for most weeks spent on the chart, breaking the previous record of 69 weeks set by LeAnn Rimes\\textbackslash{}' song \"How Do I Live\" in 1998; this record has since been broken by Imagine Dragons\\textbackslash{}' \"Radioactive\", which spent 87 weeks on the chart, and AWOLNATION\\textbackslash{}'s \"Sail\", which spent 79 weeks on the chart. As of January 2013, it is the tenth best-selling digital song of all time in the US, selling over 6 million downloads, and 12.2 million worldwide. It remains Mraz\\textbackslash{}'s biggest US hit single to date. The song was used as an \\textbackslash{}'inspiration\\textbackslash{}' for the Bollywood movie Nautanki Saala song \"Mera Mann Kehne Laga\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMraz first launched the song from the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, at Michele Clark\\textbackslash{}'s Sunset Sessions in 2008. He also sang a version on Sesame Street titled \"Outdoors\" and released a successful remixed version featuring Lil Wayne and Jah Cure.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nComposition\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAccording to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of C major (recorded a half-step lower in B major). The majority of the song contains the I-V-vi-IV progression.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nChart performance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThroughout 2008, \"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" slowly increased in airplay and digital sales and would go on to become Mraz\\textbackslash{}'s biggest hit to date, charting higher than his previous pop hit, 2003\\textbackslash{}'s \"The Remedy (I Won\\textbackslash{}'t Worry)\". It became his first top ten single in the US, peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Pop 100. On the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart the song was number one for a total of nine weeks. The single later received Mainstream Top 40 airplay, eventually topping that chart as well. Due to its gradually building crossover appeal, the song has had extremely unusual longevity, not reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40 until December 2008, ten months after its release and seven months after it debuted on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. In fact, VH1 had already retired the song in early October 2008 after a 20-week run. The song returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 for the third time in its 38th week on the chart. \"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" would go on to chart for a total of 76 weeks, making this the longest chart run in Billboard magazine history, up until the 87-week run of Imagine Dragons\\textbackslash{}' \"Radioactive\" and the 79-week run of AWOLNATION\\textbackslash{}'s \"Sail\", both set in 2014.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nA year into its release, it topped another chart for the first time, when it hit number one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks during the week of February 5, 2009. This marked 11 months since the song had topped its first chart in the US, when it reached number one on the Triple A chart in March 2008. \"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" spent 16 weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, after topping the Adult Contemporary chart, \"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" became the first song to top the Triple A, Adult Top 40, Mainstream Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts. Despite weak initial download sales, it became the eighth best-selling digital song in the United States by January 2012. It has sold 6,837,000 copies in the US as of April 23, 2014.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt is Mraz\\textbackslash{}'s most successful global single to date, reaching number one in Sweden and Norway, and the top ten in Canada, United States, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It was also able to reach number one on the Top 40 Digital Track Chart in Australia. In Hawaii, radio stations do play the original version, along with a Hawaiian remix of the song. \"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" has also been a huge hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number one, knocking off \"Poker Face\" which spent ten consecutive weeks at number one. It was certified Gold after nine weeks selling over 7,500 copies and then certified Platinum after 14 weeks selling over 15,000 copies.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"I\\textbackslash{}'m Yours\" made its debut on the British singles chart on December 12, 2008, at number 78 and then slowly climbed up the chart until it peaked at number 11. It spent the whole of 2009 on the chart apart from the final two weeks of the year, then re-entered in January 2010 and again in August, and has now clocked up 56 weeks on the official UK Top 75, making it currently the 15th longest runner of all time and the longest never to make the Top 10, at 84 weeks on the Top 100.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Creep\" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. Radiohead released \"Creep\" as their debut single in 1992, and it later appeared on their first album, Pablo Honey (1993). During its initial release, \"Creep\" was not a chart success. However, upon re-release in 1993, it became a worldwide hit. Attendees of Radiohead\\textbackslash{}'s early gigs often exhibited little interest in the band\\textbackslash{}'s other songs, causing the band to react against \"Creep\" and play it less often during the mid-to-late 1990s. It is included in the Radiohead: The Best Of compilation album.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe artwork for the single is a painting by Maurice Burns, called \"Craigavon Under Age Drinkers Rule\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAccording to Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, Thom Yorke wrote \"Creep\" while studying at Exeter University in the late 1980s. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said that the song was inspired by a girl that Yorke had followed around who showed up unexpectedly during a show by the band.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn 1992, during rehearsal sessions with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, Radiohead spontaneously performed \"Creep\". Yorke described \"Creep\" to the producers as \"our Scott Walker song\"; Slade and Kolderie mistook the singer\\textbackslash{}'s remark and believed the song was a cover. After tension arose due to unsatisfactory attempts at recording other songs, Slade and Kolderie tried to improve morale by requesting Radiohead to play \"Creep\" again. The band recorded the song in a single take; after the performance everyone in the room burst into applause. Once the band assured Kolderie that \"Creep\" was an original song, he called EMI to tell them to consider the song as Radiohead\\textbackslash{}'s next single. While the recording had minimal overdubs and the band did not intend to release it, the producers were impressed with the song.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDue to similarities to \"The Air That I Breathe\", a song recorded by the Hollies in 1973, Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood are credited as co-writers of \"Creep\". \"Creep\" uses a chord progression used in \"The Air That I Breathe\" in its verse and a melody from \"The Air That I Breathe\" in the bridge following the second chorus.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe G–B–C–Cm chord progression is repeated throughout the whole song, just alternating between arpeggiated chords in the verses and last chorus and loud power chords during the first two choruses. In G major, these may be interpreted as \"I–III–IV–iv\". According to Guy Capuzzo, the ostinato musically portrays \"the song\\textbackslash{}'s obsessive lyrics, which depict the \\textbackslash{}'self-lacerating rage of an unsuccessful crush\\textbackslash{}'.\" For example, the \"highest pitches of the ostinato form a prominent chromatic line that \\textbackslash{}'creeps\\textbackslash{}' up, then down, involving scale degrees \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}displaystyle \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat \\{5\\}\\}\\} \\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat 5– ♯ \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}displaystyle \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat \\{5\\}\\}\\} \\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat 5– \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}displaystyle \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat \\{6\\}\\}\\} \\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat 6– ♭ \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}displaystyle \\{\\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat \\{6\\}\\}\\} \\textbackslash{}\\textbackslash{}hat 6.... ascend, the lyrics strain towards optimism...descend, the subject sinks back into the throes of self-pity...The guitarist\\textbackslash{}'s fretting hand mirrors this contour\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhen the song shifts from the verse to the chorus, Jonny Greenwood plays three blasts of guitar noise (\"dead notes\" played by releasing fret-hand pressure and picking the strings). Greenwood said he did this because he did not like how quiet the song was; he explained: \"So I hit the guitar hard—really hard\". Ed O\\textbackslash{}'Brien said: \"That\\textbackslash{}'s the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn\\textbackslash{}'t like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song.\" During the song\\textbackslash{}'s outro, Jonny Greenwood plays a piano figure. Kolderie forgot to add the piano part during the final mix until the end of the song, but the band approved of the final result.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAccording to Yorke, \"Creep\" tells the tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the attention of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about \"Creep\" in 1993, Yorke said: \"I have a real problem being a man in the \\textbackslash{}'90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you\\textbackslash{}'re in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it\\textbackslash{}'s not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I\\textbackslash{}'m always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it.\" Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about \"recognizing what you are\".\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe version issued for US radio play replaced the line \"So fucking special\" with \"So very special\". The group was worried that issuing a censored version would be a \"bit of a sellout\" according to Jonny Greenwood, but they decided it was acceptable since their idols Sonic Youth had done the same thing. Nonetheless, Greenwood noted the British press \"weren\\textbackslash{}'t impressed\" by the action. During the recording session for the censored lyrics, Kolderie convinced Yorke to rewrite the first verse, telling him he thought the singer could do better.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Feel Good Inc.\" is an alternative rock song by British virtual band Gorillaz. The song features rap verses by De La Soul and showcases the band\\textbackslash{}'s alternative hip hop influences, while also containing elements of drum and bass and funk rock. The lyrical themes of the song revolve around isolation and escapism.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song was the lead single from the band\\textbackslash{}'s second studio album Demon Days on 9 May 2005. The single peaked at No. 2 in the United Kingdom and No. 14 in the United States, the band\\textbackslash{}'s highest chart positions to date. It also topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks, a first for the band. This is the only song in Damon Albarn\\textbackslash{}'s career to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked in the top 10 in 17 countries, reaching No. 1 in Spain. The song was listed in Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone\\textbackslash{}'s Best Songs of the 2000s. The song won Best Pop Collaboration at the 2006 Grammy Awards. In an interview during promotion for The Singles Collection 2001–2011, Murdoc described it as \"the song that launched a million iPods\" and \" first song ever to chart on downloads alone, infamous soundtrack to the iPod advert, Grammy award winner, backing track for Madonna\\textbackslash{}'s first holographic poledance.\" This song has surpassed \"Clint Eastwood\" to be Gorillaz\\textbackslash{}'s most successful single worldwide.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn an interview from Gorillaz\\textbackslash{}' \"iTunes Session\" in 2010, band member 2D states that the inspiration for the song came from the time he was \"passing the wind turbines out near Palm Springs. He believed he was going to the Coachella festival or something, and he passed a huge field full of those wind turbines farming the land ... so he started really with the chorus section and then built it up from there.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAt the beginning of the video, while the camera is rising up from the Feel Good Inc. tower, a sample of the Spacemonkeyz dub of \"Clint Eastwood\" entitled \"A Fistful of Peanuts\" can be heard. The main themes of the video are intellectual freedom and the media\\textbackslash{}'s dumbing down of mass culture.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn the video, 2D yearns for the freedom to join Noodle on her floating island. The characters lying on the floor represent those who have already been \"dumbed down\", while the band members are the ones who have awakened. 2D is trying to wake all the people from their half-dead state by yelling at them through his megaphone, in the style of a political activist. Jamie Hewlett said in an interview that the inspiration for some scenes in the video came from Hayao Miyazaki; specifically, the windmill-powered landmass, which has been compared to that of Miyazaki\\textbackslash{}'s Castle in the Sky. The floating island is chased by ominous helicopters, which closely resemble Korean War era Bell H-13s, monitoring the behaviour inside and ensuring that no one escapes. It is unclear whether they are preventing Noodle\\textbackslash{}'s escape or are chasing her away. Back in the tower, De La Soul appear as larger-than life, seemingly omnipotent images on surrounding television screens, laughing at the Gorillaz band members. Their taunting drives 2D into a wild, hypnotic frenzy as he tries to resist the urge to be dumbed down. At the end of the video, 2D appears beaten by his surroundings, and returns to the state he was in when the video began, repeating the words \"Feel good\" until the video finally ends, in an exact reversal of the intro. The repetition of \"Feel good\" represents that 2D is convincing himself that everything is OK (as if he is brainwashing himself to believe it), instead of facing the harsh truth of the situation. The music video for \"El Mañana\" is a continuation of this video, depicting two helicopter gunships catching up to Noodle\\textbackslash{}'s floating windmill island and attacking it.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Empire State of Mind\" is a song by American rapper Jay-Z, featuring vocals and a chorus from American singer Alicia Keys. It was released as the third single from Jay-Z\\textbackslash{}'s 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009), by his Roc Nation label in October 2009. The song is an anthemic ode to both artists\\textbackslash{}' native New York, and features a music sample of \"Love on a Two-Way Street\" (1970), written by Sylvia Robinson and Bert Keyes and performed by The Moments. \"Empire State of Mind\" was originally written by Brooklyn natives Angela Hunte and Jane\\textbackslash{}'t \"Jnay\" Sewell-Ulepic who were feeling homesick while on an overseas trip in February 2009. The following month they sent the song in for consideration at Roc Nation, although it received negative reviews. Initially discouraged, the duo sent the song to Jay-Z after a suggestion by an associate of EMI Music Publishing (EMI), and after an incident which they described as an omen.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAfter hearing the song, Jay-Z immediately recorded it, changing all of the verses but keeping the hook. The single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song\\textbackslash{}'s hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song\\textbackslash{}'s piano loop. The song was viewed as being an \"orchestral rap ballad\" and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to drugs, locations in New York and its famous residents, and describes the city\\textbackslash{}'s essence. Profanity is also present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt was included in multiple critics\\textbackslash{}' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times. The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. \"Empire State of Mind\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including; the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Italy and Sweden. The single was commercially successful in the United States, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Jay-Z\\textbackslash{}'s first number-one single on the chart as a lead artist. It appeared in 2009 year-end charts in Italy, Australia and the US. The song is also the last number one hit of the 2000s.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn the song\\textbackslash{}'s music video, which is primarily in black-and-white, Jay-Z and Keys are shown performing the song in various locations in New York. \"Empire State of Mind\" has been performed by Jay-Z and Keys multiple times, including during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2009 American Music Awards. Usually when the duo performs the song, an overhead screen shows images of places in New York. Keys has recorded a sequel entitled \"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\", which is featured on her fourth studio album The Element of Freedom (2009). Her version was positively received by critics and did well commercially, but was not as successful as its predecessor, but it was Top 10 in three countries in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. She said that she chose to record her own version of \"Empire State of Mind\" because she wanted to express her own personal feelings about New York.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe single has sold 5 million copies to date.'\n",

The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League\\textbackslash{}'s Montreal Canadiens\\textbackslash{}' home games.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song was played live to a motionless crowd at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, CA.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Fix You\" covered by Boyce Avenue was used in the video \"Internet Love Story: CTFxC Wedding (Charles \\& Alli)\" uploaded by user charlestrippy on 22 November 2011. As of 27 April 2012 it currently has 2,330,161 views.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band\\textbackslash{}'s first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete. In the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of X\\&Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King\\textbackslash{}'s Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin\\textbackslash{}'s walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song\\textbackslash{}'s finale. The audience sings along with the song\\textbackslash{}'s final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.'\n",

The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents\\textbackslash{}' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier\\textbackslash{}'s frustration with the Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. It first caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track, Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.'\n",

       "\\item[\\$strDescription] '\"Magic\" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay for their sixth studio album, Ghost Stories (2014). It was written and produced by band members Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, Chris Martin, with production assistance from Paul Epworth, Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson. The song was released as the lead single from Ghost Stories on 3 March 2014, by Parlophone. A beat consisting of a \"muffled snare\" and \"dusty bass riff\" is repeated throughout most of the song. As the song progresses, an organ is later added to the instrumentation which is eventually swapped out for a stomp-clap beat and again for a synth beat. Following the song\\textbackslash{}'s second chorus, these beats are gradually combined together while Martin sings in falsetto. The song\\textbackslash{}'s \"anticlimactic\" portion then decreases intensity until it has eventually resumed to simply a snare and bass riff.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London, England, both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008\\textbackslash{}'s Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011\\textbackslash{}'s Mylo Xyloto respectively. The song\\textbackslash{}'s bass riff, the first part of the song, was originally conceived by Guy Berryman during the band\\textbackslash{}'s recording sessions in February 2013. The song was then covered by singer/songwriter Lauren Aquilina for her BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session.'\n",

It was released on June 3, 2013 by RCA Records as the lead single from the album, following Cyrus\\textbackslash{}' departure from Hollywood Records in early 2013. \"We Can\\textbackslash{}'t Stop\" was written by Mike L. Williams II, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Timothy Thomas and Theron Thomas (known collectively as Rock City), Cyrus, Douglas Davis and Ricky Walters. The song was produced by Williams II under his production name, Mike Will Made-It, with co-production from P-Nasty and vocal production by Rock City. \"We Can\\textbackslash{}'t Stop\" is a pop, R\\&B, and dance song that lyrically talks of a house party.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nUpon its release, \"We Can\\textbackslash{}'t Stop\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and lyrics. It peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. In doing so, it tied Cyrus\\textbackslash{}' earlier song \"Party in the U.S.A.\" as her highest-peaking track in the country, where it has exceeded sales of two million copies. Internationally, the track enjoyed similar success, topping national singles charts in territories including New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAn accompanying music video was directed by Diane Martel and was released on June 19, 2013. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on Cyrus\\textbackslash{}' increasingly provocative image. Thirty-seven days after its premiere, it became the fastest clip to reach 100 million views across Vevo platforms. \"We Can\\textbackslash{}'t Stop\" was additionally promoted with a highly-controversial performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nReleased on June 19, 2013, and directed by Diane Martel, the video portrays Cyrus and her friends at a house party and, according to her, is inspired by true events. The video starts with Miley cutting off a house-arrest ankle bracelet and putting on gold teeth accessories. It also shows Cyrus making out with a doll of herself in a pool, doing her infamous \"twerking\", dancing with a giant teddy bear; and other bizarre scenes, such as a skull made out of french fries, cutting off fake fingers in the kitchen, a mountain of bread, a computer-animated mask, and smoke coming out of a man\\textbackslash{}'s crotch. The video shows vibrant colors. This aspect of Cyrus\\textbackslash{}' video was praised by critics, along with its creativity. The Director\\textbackslash{}'s Cut version has new scenes of Cyrus that weren\\textbackslash{}'t seen on the original video, such as the singing karaoke scenes.'\n",

It became one of Bowie\\'s signature songs and one of four of his songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by Stanley Kubrick\\'s film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States\\' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later and would become the first manned moon landing another five days after that. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which was and still is an unmanned project. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and possibly the music video for \"Blackstar\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie\\'s first single to chart in the UK. It reached the top five on its initial release and received the 1970 Ivor Novello Special Award for Originality. His second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song became Bowie\\'s first UK No. 1 single.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1972, Mick Rock shot a video of Bowie miming to the June 1969 recording of the song, during the sessions for Aladdin Sane. The resulting music video was used to promote the 1973 US reissue of the \"Space Oddity\" single on RCA.'\n",

It is one of Foo Fighters\\' most successful songs; only \"Learn to Fly\" and \"Best of You\" beat its position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2007 interview with XFM, frontman Dave Grohl stopped short of explaining the meaning behind \"The Pretender\", but alluded its roots go to current political unrest. Grohl noted,\\r\\n\"That\\'s the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it\\'s nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone\\'s been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they\\'re not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrohl also told XFM \"The Pretender\" was not initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\\r\\n\"That song didn\\'t happen until later on in the session. We didn\\'t go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn\\'t know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, \\'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,\\' and it just became everybody\\'s favorite song. ... It\\'s the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily. We put that song together in, I don\\'t know, a day, whereas a lot of the other songs we worked on for weeks.\"'\n",

       ":   <span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'\"Billie Jean\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer\\'s sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims to what the song\\'s lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline by guitarist David Williams, and Jackson\\'s vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \"Billie Jean\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwarded numerous honors—including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame—the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV\\'s racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson\\'s Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \"moonwalk\" also helped to popularize the song. It was also promoted through Jackson\\'s Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson\\'s scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \"Billie Jean\" sealed Jackson\\'s status as an international pop icon.\\r\\nJackson stated several times that \"Billie Jean\" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5. \"Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the \\'60s.\" He added: \"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that \"Billie Jean\" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic &amp; The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother\\'s dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.\\r\\nMichael Jackson wrote \"Billie Jean\" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: \"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That\\'s how I felt about \\'Billie Jean\\'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\" The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: \"The kid probably saved our lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson faced numerous disagreements with the song\\'s co-producer. It has been reported that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song\\'s bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson\\'s 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. \"I said, \\'Michael we\\'ve got to cut that intro\\'\" Jones later recalled. \"He said: \\'But that\\'s the jelly!\\'\\'That\\'s what makes me want to dance\\'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, \\'That\\'s what makes me want to dance\\', well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\" Jones also wanted to change the track\\'s title to \"Not My Lover\", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the demo tape sounded exactly like the finished product. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson\\'s entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, \"\\'Billie Jean\\' is hot on every level. It\\'s (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It\\'s hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It\\'s hot melodically  lyrically  vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times — unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: \"sonic personality\". \"What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat\" Swedien later wrote. \"The bottom line is that there aren\\'t many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is.\" He concluded, \"But I think that is the case with \\'Billie Jean\\' — and that I attribute to sonic personality.\"\\r\\n\"Billie Jean\" blends elements of post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson\\'s quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording “We Are the World,” Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for \"Billie Jean\" from a Hall &amp; Oates song (apparently referring to Hall\\'s \"I Can\\'t Go for That (No Can Do)\" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): \"Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn\\'t mind that he copied that groove.\" Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, \"it\\'s something we all do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson\\'s vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of \"Billie Jean\", the singer\\'s vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby\\'s eyes resemble Jackson\\'s, a voice laments, \"oh no\". This is met with Jackson\\'s signature falsetto \"hee hee\". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson\\'s vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean\\'s child.'</span>\n",

       ":   '\"Insomnia\" is the title of a song recorded by British dance group Faithless. Released as the band\\'s second single, it became one of their most successful. It was released in 1995 and became a hit in Dance Charts while peaking at #27 in the UK in 1995 and #1 in 1996 . The song also reached #48 in the UK chart as a re-entry in 2005, showing the song\\'s longevity. The album version is nearly nine minutes long and contains some lyrics not able to be broadcast on the radio edit due to their explicit content. It also contains some bells chiming at the start of the song not generally known by the club-going public as many people know the Monster Mix or the Monster Mix Radio Edit. The Monster Mix was the mix featured on Faithless\\' greatest hits album Forever Faithless. The song topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. The Moody Mix featured on some of the singles was also on the Reverence / Irreverence release.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaithless have expressed their displeasure with the fact that elements of this song were reused by Sash! for his single \"Encore Une Fois\". Norwegian electronica artist Biosphere has claimed that Faithless sampled the bassline from his single \"Novelty Waves\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song is widely considered to be one of the best dance floor anthems of all time, and sparked off a new genre of music.'\n",

       ":   '\"Schism\" is a song by American rock band Tool. It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, Lateralus. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.\\r\\n\"Schism\" was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Schism\" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times. The song begins with two bars of 5/4, followed by one bar of 4/4, followed by bars of alternating 5/8 and 7/8, until the first interlude, which consists of alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8.\\r\\nThe following verse exhibits a similar pattern to the first, alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8. The next section is bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. This takes the song back into alternating 5/8 and 7/8. Another 6/8 and 7/8 section follows, and after this the song goes into repeating 7/8 bars.\\r\\nThe middle section is subsequently introduced, consisting of three bars of 6/8, one bar of 3/8, and one bar of 3/4 repeating several times. At one point it interrupts with two bars of 6/8 followed by a bar of 4/8, twice. A bar of 5/8 is played before the meter switches back to 6/8 for two bars and 2/4 for one bar. This repeats, setting up another section: two bars of 9/8 followed by a bar of 10/8, that pattern again, and then a single bar of 9/8 followed by alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8. The outro has alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8, ending with alternating 6/8, 2/8 that one could interpret as pulsing with a 4/4 feel.\\r\\nThe band has referred to the time signature as 6.5/8. Although many composers would use 13/16 instead, 6.5/8 is still a valid fractional time signature.'\n",

       ":   <span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'\"Karma Police\" is a song by English alternative rock band Radiohead from their 1997 third studio album OK Computer. The song\\'s title and lyrics derive from an in-joke among the band, referring to the Hindu theory of cause and effect, known as karma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Karma Police\" was released as the second single from OK Computer, and became a commercial success, charting at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number fourteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Critical reception to the single was also favourable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 the song was featured on the Radiohead: The Best Of collection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Karma Police\", like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on tour. A live version of \"Karma Police\", performed with a Rhodes piano on the Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Karma Police\" is in a 4/4 time signature and played in standard tuning. The first half of the song is in the key of E minor, and would feature a Neapolitan chord (F). The second half (starting with the line \"For a minute there\") is in B minor. Acoustic guitar and piano are the most prominent instruments in the song, and the chord progression owes an audible debt to The Beatles song \"Sexy Sadie\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of the song is unconventional in that it has nothing resembling a typical chorus. Instead, the song progresses from the intro into a mid-tempo section which alternates between two verses. The first verse begins with the line \"Karma police\", and the other begins with the line \"This is what you\\'ll get\". During the second section the drums drop out and an analog synthesizer imitating a choir is featured. After this section cycles through twice, the song switches into a second section which is based around the line \"For a minute there, I lost myself\". During this section of the song, Yorke\\'s voice is put through an echo effect and a sliding melodic figure serves as a counterpoint to Yorke\\'s vocals. In the outro, Ed O\\'Brien plays a few notes on his guitar, which are distorted by overloading an AMS rackmount digital delay unit and turning the delay rate knob down.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiohead members used to tell one another that they would call \"the karma police\" on them if they did something bad. The joke was incorporated into the lyrics and title of the song. Yorke explained that the song was about stress and \"having people looking at you in that certain  way, I can\\'t handle it anymore\". Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, \"It\\'s for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!\" Yorke and Jonny Greenwood emphasised in interviews that the song had a humorous bent; Yorke said, \" not entirely serious, I hope people will realize that.\" The song includes the line \"He buzzes like a fridge/He\\'s like a detuned radio\", a reference to the distracting, metaphorical background noise Yorke calls \"fridge buzz\". Yorke has said that the idea of fridge buzz is one of the primary themes of OK Computer. \"Karma Police\" also shares themes of insanity and dissatisfaction with capitalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jonathan Glazer, previously responsible for Radiohead\\'s \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" clip. The video premiered in August 1997 and featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke as well as Hungarian actor Lajos Kovács. Glazer won MTV\\'s Director of the Year award in 1997 for his work on this, as well as Jamiroquai\\'s \"Virtual Insanity\". Glazer however revealed in an interview that he considers this video to be a failed attempt. According to MTV.com, Glazer had pitched the concept of the \"Karma Police\" video months earlier to Marilyn Manson, who disliked it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video starts with the camera, an unseen driver, looking at the empty back seat of a 1976 Chrysler New Yorker at night. The \\'driver\\' then faces the windscreen and begins driving. For 35 seconds, it shows nothing but a road through grass illuminated by headlights, with insects visible around the windscreen. A figure is then seen running from the car. In time for the chorus the view shifts back to the back seat, where Thom Yorke now sits, almost mumbling his lyrics. The view yet again moves to the figure, who is close to being mown down, as the view again switches to Yorke, now slouching drowsily against the back of the front seat, barely lipsyncing any longer. The camera swivels again and the figure appears again, close this time. For the first time another perspective reveals the outside of the car. The pursued figure sharpens and is revealed to be a large man with a frightened look. The car comes to a stop before him, then reverses slightly, as if for a \\'run up\\', and this reveals it to be leaking fuel. The man realises the car has a petrol leak and puts his hands behind his back as if in resignation, then takes matches from his pocket, lights one, and throws it down. The perspective shifts to the car\\'s interior. The car suddenly reverses, away from the man, a path of fire now blazes back towards the car. The car slowly catches fire, and the camera/driver finally turns frantically to the back seat and robotically swivels back and forth, only to find that Yorke is no longer there.'</span>\n",

       ":   '\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band\\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic.\\r\\nThe unexpected success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana\\'s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.\\r\\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics\\' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain\\'s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.'\n",

       ":   '\"Can\\'t Hold Us\" is a song by American rapper Macklemore and producer Ryan Lewis from their collaborative album The Heist (2012). Featuring singer Ray Dalton, it was released as the third single from the album on August 16, 2011. The song also features additional vocals by actress Susannah Wetzel, who sings portions of the chorus alongside Dalton.\\r\\nThe song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their second number-one hit in the United States. It is also their third consecutive number-one single in Australia.\\r\\nThe radio edit cuts out portions of the introduction, as well as the extended bridge section and an alternate beat during the last chorus, replacing them with an introduction from Dalton and a clapping beat.

The picture of the band in Santa outfits used on the cover was taken at the Aylesbury Fair, while the band were on tour.\\r\\nBronze also issued German and Spanish 7\" vinyl versions which had a different sleeves, as well as a Japanese release, with a colour picture insert with song lyrics in English and Japanese. One sided test pressings (not mis-presses, but used in the trade) escaped the pressing plant and are on the market.\\r\\nThe song opens with an overdriven bass solo played by Lemmy. For the lyrics, he said he \"used gambling metaphors, mostly cards and dice – when it comes to that sort of thing, I\\'m more into the one-arm bandits actually, but you can\\'t really sing about spinning fruit, and the wheels coming down\".\\r\\nOn 6 September 1980 Lemmy was interviewed by Graham Neale on BBC Radio 1\\'s Rock On Saturday show, \"Bomber\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Love Me Like a Reptile\" were played. The following month, on 6 and 20 October, the band played the song on BBC TV show Top of the Pops.\\r\\nIn the studio version, the last lines of the bridge are \"I don\\'t want to live forever/And don\\'t forget the Joker\". In the live versions and the Rock Band 2 remake, the last lines are \"I don\\'t want to live forever/But, apparently I am\".'\n",

He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, passers-by then repeatedly bump into him (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of The Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance.'\n",

       ":   <span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'\"Bring Me to Life\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \"Bring Me to Life\" in 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence\\'s debut studio album, Fallen. The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist\\'s life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee\\'s vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp Stölzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bring Me to Life\" was directed by Philipp Stölzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, Stölzl said: \"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul\\'s arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.'</span>\n",

       ":   '\"Smack My Bitch Up\" is a song by British big beat group the Prodigy. It was released in November 1997 as the third and final single from the album The Fat of the Land. The song was voted by Mixmag readers as the third greatest dance record of all time. Although the song wasn\\'t as big a commercial success as their previous singles, it gained a cult following.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song caused considerable controversy because of its allegedly misogynistic title and its video, which depicted scenes of drunken and drug-fuelled sexual excess and violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the release of the single, Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.'\n",

       ":   '\"Call Me Maybe\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) and appearing on her international debut album, Kiss. The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on 20 September 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \"Call Me Maybe\" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content. \"Call Me Maybe\" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders &amp; Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position in Canada, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007\\'s \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne. With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, \"Call Me Maybe\" is one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, the singer has performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. \"Call Me Maybe\" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil\\' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Nickelback, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, Glee and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on the season premiere episode, \"The New Rachel\", of the fourth season of Glee. The song used in in other television shows, Castle, Jane by Design, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and 90210.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call Me Maybe\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, which will be held on 10 February 2013. On 11 December 2012, \"Call Me Maybe\" was named Song of the Year of 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard Magazine ranked this song #2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 Songs charts, in each case behind \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice\\'s annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling 10 million copies in that year alone, and best-selling single in iTunes Store in 2012.'\n",

It was also used for the Australian Seven Network\\'s promotion of the season premiere of Packed to the Rafters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m Yours\" was immensely successful in the US on the Billboard charts. At 76 weeks on the Hot 100, it held the record for most weeks spent on the chart, breaking the previous record of 69 weeks set by LeAnn Rimes\\' song \"How Do I Live\" in 1998; this record has since been broken by Imagine Dragons\\' \"Radioactive\", which spent 87 weeks on the chart, and AWOLNATION\\'s \"Sail\", which spent 79 weeks on the chart. As of January 2013, it is the tenth best-selling digital song of all time in the US, selling over 6 million downloads, and 12.2 million worldwide. It remains Mraz\\'s biggest US hit single to date. The song was used as an \\'inspiration\\' for the Bollywood movie Nautanki Saala song \"Mera Mann Kehne Laga\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMraz first launched the song from the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, at Michele Clark\\'s Sunset Sessions in 2008. He also sang a version on Sesame Street titled \"Outdoors\" and released a successful remixed version featuring Lil Wayne and Jah Cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nComposition\\r\\nAccording to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of C major (recorded a half-step lower in B major). The majority of the song contains the I-V-vi-IV progression.\\r\\n\\r\\nChart performance\\r\\nThroughout 2008, \"I\\'m Yours\" slowly increased in airplay and digital sales and would go on to become Mraz\\'s biggest hit to date, charting higher than his previous pop hit, 2003\\'s \"The Remedy (I Won\\'t Worry)\". It became his first top ten single in the US, peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Pop 100. On the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart the song was number one for a total of nine weeks. The single later received Mainstream Top 40 airplay, eventually topping that chart as well. Due to its gradually building crossover appeal, the song has had extremely unusual longevity, not reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40 until December 2008, ten months after its release and seven months after it debuted on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. In fact, VH1 had already retired the song in early October 2008 after a 20-week run. The song returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 for the third time in its 38th week on the chart. \"I\\'m Yours\" would go on to chart for a total of 76 weeks, making this the longest chart run in Billboard magazine history, up until the 87-week run of Imagine Dragons\\' \"Radioactive\" and the 79-week run of AWOLNATION\\'s \"Sail\", both set in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year into its release, it topped another chart for the first time, when it hit number one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks during the week of February 5, 2009. This marked 11 months since the song had topped its first chart in the US, when it reached number one on the Triple A chart in March 2008. \"I\\'m Yours\" spent 16 weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, after topping the Adult Contemporary chart, \"I\\'m Yours\" became the first song to top the Triple A, Adult Top 40, Mainstream Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts. Despite weak initial download sales, it became the eighth best-selling digital song in the United States by January 2012. It has sold 6,837,000 copies in the US as of April 23, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is Mraz\\'s most successful global single to date, reaching number one in Sweden and Norway, and the top ten in Canada, United States, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It was also able to reach number one on the Top 40 Digital Track Chart in Australia. In Hawaii, radio stations do play the original version, along with a Hawaiian remix of the song. \"I\\'m Yours\" has also been a huge hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number one, knocking off \"Poker Face\" which spent ten consecutive weeks at number one. It was certified Gold after nine weeks selling over 7,500 copies and then certified Platinum after 14 weeks selling over 15,000 copies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m Yours\" made its debut on the British singles chart on December 12, 2008, at number 78 and then slowly climbed up the chart until it peaked at number 11. It spent the whole of 2009 on the chart apart from the final two weeks of the year, then re-entered in January 2010 and again in August, and has now clocked up 56 weeks on the official UK Top 75, making it currently the 15th longest runner of all time and the longest never to make the Top 10, at 84 weeks on the Top 100.'\n",

       ":   '\"Creep\" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. Radiohead released \"Creep\" as their debut single in 1992, and it later appeared on their first album, Pablo Honey (1993). During its initial release, \"Creep\" was not a chart success. However, upon re-release in 1993, it became a worldwide hit. Attendees of Radiohead\\'s early gigs often exhibited little interest in the band\\'s other songs, causing the band to react against \"Creep\" and play it less often during the mid-to-late 1990s. It is included in the Radiohead: The Best Of compilation album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artwork for the single is a painting by Maurice Burns, called \"Craigavon Under Age Drinkers Rule\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, Thom Yorke wrote \"Creep\" while studying at Exeter University in the late 1980s. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said that the song was inspired by a girl that Yorke had followed around who showed up unexpectedly during a show by the band.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, during rehearsal sessions with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, Radiohead spontaneously performed \"Creep\". Yorke described \"Creep\" to the producers as \"our Scott Walker song\"; Slade and Kolderie mistook the singer\\'s remark and believed the song was a cover. After tension arose due to unsatisfactory attempts at recording other songs, Slade and Kolderie tried to improve morale by requesting Radiohead to play \"Creep\" again. The band recorded the song in a single take; after the performance everyone in the room burst into applause. Once the band assured Kolderie that \"Creep\" was an original song, he called EMI to tell them to consider the song as Radiohead\\'s next single. While the recording had minimal overdubs and the band did not intend to release it, the producers were impressed with the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to similarities to \"The Air That I Breathe\", a song recorded by the Hollies in 1973, Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood are credited as co-writers of \"Creep\". \"Creep\" uses a chord progression used in \"The Air That I Breathe\" in its verse and a melody from \"The Air That I Breathe\" in the bridge following the second chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe G–B–C–Cm chord progression is repeated throughout the whole song, just alternating between arpeggiated chords in the verses and last chorus and loud power chords during the first two choruses. In G major, these may be interpreted as \"I–III–IV–iv\". According to Guy Capuzzo, the ostinato musically portrays \"the song\\'s obsessive lyrics, which depict the \\'self-lacerating rage of an unsuccessful crush\\'.\" For example, the \"highest pitches of the ostinato form a prominent chromatic line that \\'creeps\\' up, then down, involving scale degrees {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {5}}} \\\\hat 5– ♯ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {5}}} \\\\hat 5– {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {6}}} \\\\hat 6– ♭ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {6}}} \\\\hat 6.... ascend, the lyrics strain towards optimism...descend, the subject sinks back into the throes of self-pity...The guitarist\\'s fretting hand mirrors this contour\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the song shifts from the verse to the chorus, Jonny Greenwood plays three blasts of guitar noise (\"dead notes\" played by releasing fret-hand pressure and picking the strings). Greenwood said he did this because he did not like how quiet the song was; he explained: \"So I hit the guitar hard—really hard\". Ed O\\'Brien said: \"That\\'s the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn\\'t like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song.\" During the song\\'s outro, Jonny Greenwood plays a piano figure. Kolderie forgot to add the piano part during the final mix until the end of the song, but the band approved of the final result.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Yorke, \"Creep\" tells the tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the attention of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about \"Creep\" in 1993, Yorke said: \"I have a real problem being a man in the \\'90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you\\'re in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it\\'s not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I\\'m always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it.\" Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about \"recognizing what you are\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe version issued for US radio play replaced the line \"So fucking special\" with \"So very special\". The group was worried that issuing a censored version would be a \"bit of a sellout\" according to Jonny Greenwood, but they decided it was acceptable since their idols Sonic Youth had done the same thing. Nonetheless, Greenwood noted the British press \"weren\\'t impressed\" by the action. During the recording session for the censored lyrics, Kolderie convinced Yorke to rewrite the first verse, telling him he thought the singer could do better.'\n",

       ":   '\"Feel Good Inc.\" is an alternative rock song by British virtual band Gorillaz. The song features rap verses by De La Soul and showcases the band\\'s alternative hip hop influences, while also containing elements of drum and bass and funk rock. The lyrical themes of the song revolve around isolation and escapism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was the lead single from the band\\'s second studio album Demon Days on 9 May 2005. The single peaked at No. 2 in the United Kingdom and No. 14 in the United States, the band\\'s highest chart positions to date. It also topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks, a first for the band. This is the only song in Damon Albarn\\'s career to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked in the top 10 in 17 countries, reaching No. 1 in Spain. The song was listed in Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone\\'s Best Songs of the 2000s. The song won Best Pop Collaboration at the 2006 Grammy Awards. In an interview during promotion for The Singles Collection 2001–2011, Murdoc described it as \"the song that launched a million iPods\" and \" first song ever to chart on downloads alone, infamous soundtrack to the iPod advert, Grammy award winner, backing track for Madonna\\'s first holographic poledance.\" This song has surpassed \"Clint Eastwood\" to be Gorillaz\\'s most successful single worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview from Gorillaz\\' \"iTunes Session\" in 2010, band member 2D states that the inspiration for the song came from the time he was \"passing the wind turbines out near Palm Springs. He believed he was going to the Coachella festival or something, and he passed a huge field full of those wind turbines farming the land ... so he started really with the chorus section and then built it up from there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the video, while the camera is rising up from the Feel Good Inc. tower, a sample of the Spacemonkeyz dub of \"Clint Eastwood\" entitled \"A Fistful of Peanuts\" can be heard. The main themes of the video are intellectual freedom and the media\\'s dumbing down of mass culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the video, 2D yearns for the freedom to join Noodle on her floating island. The characters lying on the floor represent those who have already been \"dumbed down\", while the band members are the ones who have awakened. 2D is trying to wake all the people from their half-dead state by yelling at them through his megaphone, in the style of a political activist. Jamie Hewlett said in an interview that the inspiration for some scenes in the video came from Hayao Miyazaki; specifically, the windmill-powered landmass, which has been compared to that of Miyazaki\\'s Castle in the Sky. The floating island is chased by ominous helicopters, which closely resemble Korean War era Bell H-13s, monitoring the behaviour inside and ensuring that no one escapes. It is unclear whether they are preventing Noodle\\'s escape or are chasing her away. Back in the tower, De La Soul appear as larger-than life, seemingly omnipotent images on surrounding television screens, laughing at the Gorillaz band members. Their taunting drives 2D into a wild, hypnotic frenzy as he tries to resist the urge to be dumbed down. At the end of the video, 2D appears beaten by his surroundings, and returns to the state he was in when the video began, repeating the words \"Feel good\" until the video finally ends, in an exact reversal of the intro. The repetition of \"Feel good\" represents that 2D is convincing himself that everything is OK (as if he is brainwashing himself to believe it), instead of facing the harsh truth of the situation. The music video for \"El Mañana\" is a continuation of this video, depicting two helicopter gunships catching up to Noodle\\'s floating windmill island and attacking it.'\n",

       ":   '\"Empire State of Mind\" is a song by American rapper Jay-Z, featuring vocals and a chorus from American singer Alicia Keys. It was released as the third single from Jay-Z\\'s 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009), by his Roc Nation label in October 2009. The song is an anthemic ode to both artists\\' native New York, and features a music sample of \"Love on a Two-Way Street\" (1970), written by Sylvia Robinson and Bert Keyes and performed by The Moments. \"Empire State of Mind\" was originally written by Brooklyn natives Angela Hunte and Jane\\'t \"Jnay\" Sewell-Ulepic who were feeling homesick while on an overseas trip in February 2009. The following month they sent the song in for consideration at Roc Nation, although it received negative reviews. Initially discouraged, the duo sent the song to Jay-Z after a suggestion by an associate of EMI Music Publishing (EMI), and after an incident which they described as an omen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hearing the song, Jay-Z immediately recorded it, changing all of the verses but keeping the hook. The single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song\\'s hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song\\'s piano loop. The song was viewed as being an \"orchestral rap ballad\" and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to drugs, locations in New York and its famous residents, and describes the city\\'s essence. Profanity is also present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was included in multiple critics\\' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times. The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. \"Empire State of Mind\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including; the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Italy and Sweden. The single was commercially successful in the United States, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Jay-Z\\'s first number-one single on the chart as a lead artist. It appeared in 2009 year-end charts in Italy, Australia and the US. The song is also the last number one hit of the 2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the song\\'s music video, which is primarily in black-and-white, Jay-Z and Keys are shown performing the song in various locations in New York. \"Empire State of Mind\" has been performed by Jay-Z and Keys multiple times, including during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2009 American Music Awards. Usually when the duo performs the song, an overhead screen shows images of places in New York. Keys has recorded a sequel entitled \"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\", which is featured on her fourth studio album The Element of Freedom (2009). Her version was positively received by critics and did well commercially, but was not as successful as its predecessor, but it was Top 10 in three countries in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. She said that she chose to record her own version of \"Empire State of Mind\" because she wanted to express her own personal feelings about New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single has sold 5 million copies to date.'\n",

       ":   '\"Fix You\" is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was written by all four members of the band for their third album, X&amp;Y. The track is built around an organ, that is accompanied by slow tempo drums, and a vocals. It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&amp;Y and has reached number four in the United Kingdom Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US.\\r\\nBlythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\\'s mother-in-law, stated in an interview in May 2012 that Chris Martin \\'wrote the song Fix You for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it\\'.\\r\\n\"Fix You\" received positive reviews. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The song, itself, was nominated for multiple awards in the categories of Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Anthem of the Summer. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\\r\\nThe guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League\\'s Montreal Canadiens\\' home games.\\r\\nThe song was played live to a motionless crowd at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, CA.\\r\\n\"Fix You\" covered by Boyce Avenue was used in the video \"Internet Love Story: CTFxC Wedding (Charles &amp; Alli)\" uploaded by user charlestrippy on 22 November 2011. As of 27 April 2012 it currently has 2,330,161 views.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band\\'s first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete. In the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of X&amp;Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King\\'s Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin\\'s walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song\\'s finale. The audience sings along with the song\\'s final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.'\n",

The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents\\' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier\\'s frustration with the Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. It first caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track, Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.'\n",

       ":   '\"Magic\" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay for their sixth studio album, Ghost Stories (2014). It was written and produced by band members Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, Chris Martin, with production assistance from Paul Epworth, Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson. The song was released as the lead single from Ghost Stories on 3 March 2014, by Parlophone. A beat consisting of a \"muffled snare\" and \"dusty bass riff\" is repeated throughout most of the song. As the song progresses, an organ is later added to the instrumentation which is eventually swapped out for a stomp-clap beat and again for a synth beat. Following the song\\'s second chorus, these beats are gradually combined together while Martin sings in falsetto. The song\\'s \"anticlimactic\" portion then decreases intensity until it has eventually resumed to simply a snare and bass riff.\\r\\nThe song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London, England, both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008\\'s Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011\\'s Mylo Xyloto respectively. The song\\'s bass riff, the first part of the song, was originally conceived by Guy Berryman during the band\\'s recording sessions in February 2013. The song was then covered by singer/songwriter Lauren Aquilina for her BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session.'\n",

       ":   '\"We Can\\'t Stop\" is a song by American recording artist Miley Cyrus for her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). It was released on June 3, 2013 by RCA Records as the lead single from the album, following Cyrus\\' departure from Hollywood Records in early 2013. \"We Can\\'t Stop\" was written by Mike L. Williams II, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Timothy Thomas and Theron Thomas (known collectively as Rock City), Cyrus, Douglas Davis and Ricky Walters. The song was produced by Williams II under his production name, Mike Will Made-It, with co-production from P-Nasty and vocal production by Rock City. \"We Can\\'t Stop\" is a pop, R&amp;B, and dance song that lyrically talks of a house party.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its release, \"We Can\\'t Stop\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and lyrics. It peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. In doing so, it tied Cyrus\\' earlier song \"Party in the U.S.A.\" as her highest-peaking track in the country, where it has exceeded sales of two million copies. Internationally, the track enjoyed similar success, topping national singles charts in territories including New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Diane Martel and was released on June 19, 2013. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on Cyrus\\' increasingly provocative image. Thirty-seven days after its premiere, it became the fastest clip to reach 100 million views across Vevo platforms. \"We Can\\'t Stop\" was additionally promoted with a highly-controversial performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased on June 19, 2013, and directed by Diane Martel, the video portrays Cyrus and her friends at a house party and, according to her, is inspired by true events. The video starts with Miley cutting off a house-arrest ankle bracelet and putting on gold teeth accessories. It also shows Cyrus making out with a doll of herself in a pool, doing her infamous \"twerking\", dancing with a giant teddy bear; and other bizarre scenes, such as a skull made out of french fries, cutting off fake fingers in the kitchen, a mountain of bread, a computer-animated mask, and smoke coming out of a man\\'s crotch. The video shows vibrant colors. This aspect of Cyrus\\' video was praised by critics, along with its creativity. The Director\\'s Cut version has new scenes of Cyrus that weren\\'t seen on the original video, such as the singing karaoke scenes.'\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Space Oddity\\\" is a song written and recorded by David Bowie. It was first released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of his second studio album, David Bowie. It became one of Bowie's signature songs and one of four of his songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later and would become the first manned moon landing another five days after that. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which was and still is an unmanned project. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \\\"Ashes to Ashes\\\", \\\"Hallo Spaceboy\\\" and possibly the music video for \\\"Blackstar\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Space Oddity\\\" was David Bowie's first single to chart in the UK. It reached the top five on its initial release and received the 1970 Ivor Novello Special Award for Originality. His second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song became Bowie's first UK No. 1 single.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1972, Mick Rock shot a video of Bowie miming to the June 1969 recording of the song, during the sessions for Aladdin Sane. The resulting music video was used to promote the 1973 US reissue of the \\\"Space Oddity\\\" single on RCA.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"The Pretender\\\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Foo Fighters. It was the first single from the group's 2007 album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. It is one of Foo Fighters' most successful songs; only \\\"Learn to Fly\\\" and \\\"Best of You\\\" beat its position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2007 interview with XFM, frontman Dave Grohl stopped short of explaining the meaning behind \\\"The Pretender\\\", but alluded its roots go to current political unrest. Grohl noted,\\r\\n\\\"That's the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it's nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone's been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they're not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrohl also told XFM \\\"The Pretender\\\" was not initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\\r\\n\\\"That song didn't happen until later on in the session. We didn't go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn't know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, 'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,' and it just became everybody's favorite song. ... It's the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily. We put that song together in, I don't know, a day, whereas a lot of the other songs we worked on for weeks.\\\"\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Billie Jean\\\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer's sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims to what the song's lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \\\"Billie Jean\\\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline by guitarist David Williams, and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \\\"Billie Jean\\\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwarded numerous honors—including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame—the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV's racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson's Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \\\"moonwalk\\\" also helped to popularize the song. It was also promoted through Jackson's Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson's scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \\\"Billie Jean\\\" sealed Jackson's status as an international pop icon.\\r\\nJackson stated several times that \\\"Billie Jean\\\" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5. \\\"Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s.\\\" He added: \\\"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that \\\"Billie Jean\\\" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic & The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.\\r\\nMichael Jackson wrote \\\"Billie Jean\\\" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: \\\"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\\\" The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: \\\"The kid probably saved our lives.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson faced numerous disagreements with the song's co-producer. It has been reported that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. \\\"I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'\\\" Jones later recalled. \\\"He said: 'But that's the jelly!''That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\\\" Jones also wanted to change the track's title to \\\"Not My Lover\\\", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the demo tape sounded exactly like the finished product. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson's entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, \\\"'Billie Jean' is hot on every level. It's (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It's hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It's hot melodically  lyrically  vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times — unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: \\\"sonic personality\\\". \\\"What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat\\\" Swedien later wrote. \\\"The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is.\\\" He concluded, \\\"But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean' — and that I attribute to sonic personality.\\\"\\r\\n\\\"Billie Jean\\\" blends elements of post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson's quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording “We Are the World,” Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for \\\"Billie Jean\\\" from a Hall & Oates song (apparently referring to Hall's \\\"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\\\" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): \\\"Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn't mind that he copied that groove.\\\" Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, \\\"it's something we all do.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of \\\"Billie Jean\\\", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, \\\"oh no\\\". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto \\\"hee hee\\\". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Insomnia\\\" is the title of a song recorded by British dance group Faithless. Released as the band's second single, it became one of their most successful. It was released in 1995 and became a hit in Dance Charts while peaking at #27 in the UK in 1995 and #1 in 1996 . The song also reached #48 in the UK chart as a re-entry in 2005, showing the song's longevity. The album version is nearly nine minutes long and contains some lyrics not able to be broadcast on the radio edit due to their explicit content. It also contains some bells chiming at the start of the song not generally known by the club-going public as many people know the Monster Mix or the Monster Mix Radio Edit. The Monster Mix was the mix featured on Faithless' greatest hits album Forever Faithless. The song topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. The Moody Mix featured on some of the singles was also on the Reverence / Irreverence release.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaithless have expressed their displeasure with the fact that elements of this song were reused by Sash! for his single \\\"Encore Une Fois\\\". Norwegian electronica artist Biosphere has claimed that Faithless sampled the bassline from his single \\\"Novelty Waves\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song is widely considered to be one of the best dance floor anthems of all time, and sparked off a new genre of music.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Schism\\\" is a song by American rock band Tool. It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, Lateralus. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.\\r\\n\\\"Schism\\\" was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Schism\\\" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times. The song begins with two bars of 5/4, followed by one bar of 4/4, followed by bars of alternating 5/8 and 7/8, until the first interlude, which consists of alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8.\\r\\nThe following verse exhibits a similar pattern to the first, alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8. The next section is bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. This takes the song back into alternating 5/8 and 7/8. Another 6/8 and 7/8 section follows, and after this the song goes into repeating 7/8 bars.\\r\\nThe middle section is subsequently introduced, consisting of three bars of 6/8, one bar of 3/8, and one bar of 3/4 repeating several times. At one point it interrupts with two bars of 6/8 followed by a bar of 4/8, twice. A bar of 5/8 is played before the meter switches back to 6/8 for two bars and 2/4 for one bar. This repeats, setting up another section: two bars of 9/8 followed by a bar of 10/8, that pattern again, and then a single bar of 9/8 followed by alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8. The outro has alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8, ending with alternating 6/8, 2/8 that one could interpret as pulsing with a 4/4 feel.\\r\\nThe band has referred to the time signature as 6.5/8. Although many composers would use 13/16 instead, 6.5/8 is still a valid fractional time signature.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Karma Police\\\" is a song by English alternative rock band Radiohead from their 1997 third studio album OK Computer. The song's title and lyrics derive from an in-joke among the band, referring to the Hindu theory of cause and effect, known as karma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Karma Police\\\" was released as the second single from OK Computer, and became a commercial success, charting at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number fourteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Critical reception to the single was also favourable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 the song was featured on the Radiohead: The Best Of collection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Karma Police\\\", like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on tour. A live version of \\\"Karma Police\\\", performed with a Rhodes piano on the Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Karma Police\\\" is in a 4/4 time signature and played in standard tuning. The first half of the song is in the key of E minor, and would feature a Neapolitan chord (F). The second half (starting with the line \\\"For a minute there\\\") is in B minor. Acoustic guitar and piano are the most prominent instruments in the song, and the chord progression owes an audible debt to The Beatles song \\\"Sexy Sadie\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of the song is unconventional in that it has nothing resembling a typical chorus. Instead, the song progresses from the intro into a mid-tempo section which alternates between two verses. The first verse begins with the line \\\"Karma police\\\", and the other begins with the line \\\"This is what you'll get\\\". During the second section the drums drop out and an analog synthesizer imitating a choir is featured. After this section cycles through twice, the song switches into a second section which is based around the line \\\"For a minute there, I lost myself\\\". During this section of the song, Yorke's voice is put through an echo effect and a sliding melodic figure serves as a counterpoint to Yorke's vocals. In the outro, Ed O'Brien plays a few notes on his guitar, which are distorted by overloading an AMS rackmount digital delay unit and turning the delay rate knob down.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiohead members used to tell one another that they would call \\\"the karma police\\\" on them if they did something bad. The joke was incorporated into the lyrics and title of the song. Yorke explained that the song was about stress and \\\"having people looking at you in that certain  way, I can't handle it anymore\\\". Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, \\\"It's for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!\\\" Yorke and Jonny Greenwood emphasised in interviews that the song had a humorous bent; Yorke said, \\\" not entirely serious, I hope people will realize that.\\\" The song includes the line \\\"He buzzes like a fridge/He's like a detuned radio\\\", a reference to the distracting, metaphorical background noise Yorke calls \\\"fridge buzz\\\". Yorke has said that the idea of fridge buzz is one of the primary themes of OK Computer. \\\"Karma Police\\\" also shares themes of insanity and dissatisfaction with capitalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jonathan Glazer, previously responsible for Radiohead's \\\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\\" clip. The video premiered in August 1997 and featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke as well as Hungarian actor Lajos Kovács. Glazer won MTV's Director of the Year award in 1997 for his work on this, as well as Jamiroquai's \\\"Virtual Insanity\\\". Glazer however revealed in an interview that he considers this video to be a failed attempt. According to MTV.com, Glazer had pitched the concept of the \\\"Karma Police\\\" video months earlier to Marilyn Manson, who disliked it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video starts with the camera, an unseen driver, looking at the empty back seat of a 1976 Chrysler New Yorker at night. The 'driver' then faces the windscreen and begins driving. For 35 seconds, it shows nothing but a road through grass illuminated by headlights, with insects visible around the windscreen. A figure is then seen running from the car. In time for the chorus the view shifts back to the back seat, where Thom Yorke now sits, almost mumbling his lyrics. The view yet again moves to the figure, who is close to being mown down, as the view again switches to Yorke, now slouching drowsily against the back of the front seat, barely lipsyncing any longer. The camera swivels again and the figure appears again, close this time. For the first time another perspective reveals the outside of the car. The pursued figure sharpens and is revealed to be a large man with a frightened look. The car comes to a stop before him, then reverses slightly, as if for a 'run up', and this reveals it to be leaking fuel. The man realises the car has a petrol leak and puts his hands behind his back as if in resignation, then takes matches from his pocket, lights one, and throws it down. The perspective shifts to the car's interior. The car suddenly reverses, away from the man, a path of fire now blazes back towards the car. The car slowly catches fire, and the camera/driver finally turns frantically to the back seat and robotically swivels back and forth, only to find that Yorke is no longer there.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic.\\r\\nThe unexpected success of \\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\" was Nirvana's biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.\\r\\n\\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \\\"anthem for apathetic kids\\\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain's death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\" as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Can't Hold Us\\\" is a song by American rapper Macklemore and producer Ryan Lewis from their collaborative album The Heist (2012). Featuring singer Ray Dalton, it was released as the third single from the album on August 16, 2011. The song also features additional vocals by actress Susannah Wetzel, who sings portions of the chorus alongside Dalton.\\r\\nThe song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their second number-one hit in the United States. It is also their third consecutive number-one single in Australia.\\r\\nThe radio edit cuts out portions of the introduction, as well as the extended bridge section and an alternate beat during the last chorus, replacing them with an introduction from Dalton and a clapping beat. The beat is similar to their live performances of the song. The song is in the key of E minor with a tempo set at 146 beats per minute.\\r\\nMacklemore premiered the music video for \\\"Can't Hold Us\\\" on April 17, 2013. The video was directed by Ryan Lewis, Jason Koenig & Jon Jon Augustavo, and shooting took place for three months, on 2 continents and 16 different shoots, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to Southern California to New Zealand at Cathedral Cove where scenes for The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian were also shot. Several prominent parts were filmed on the tall ship Lady Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video won two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Hip-Hop Video and Best Cinematography, and was nominated for Best Direction and Best Editing. It also was place at No. 12 on BET Notarized Top 100 in 2013. It was nominated for Best Music Video at the 2014 Grammy Awards.\\r\\nIn May 2012, the song was re-released and featured in an International TV commercial for Miller Genuine Draft, created by the advertising agency me&lewis ideas. In early 2013, the song was used in a U.S. television commercial for Microsoft's Outlook.com webmail service. The song was also used in the background of ESPN College GameDay commercials, the March 2013 premiere episode of MTV's The Real World: Portland, in commercials for the movie R.I.P.D. and in the trailer for the film Grudge Match. It is featured on the soundtrack for the 2013 film on Steve Jobs titled Jobs and the American basketball video game NBA 2K14. On July 2, 2013, mash-up artist DJ Earworm released a summer mash-up, incorporating \\\"Can't Hold Us\\\" with 10 other songs that became popular in summer 2013. In late 2013, the chorus from the song was used in an ad campaign for the opening of the Graton Resort & Casino in Northern California. The song was also used in YouTube's annual Rewind video. The songs segment in the video features YouTube stars, The Slow Mo Guys.\"\n",

It is the longest-running number one single in New Zealand since Smashproof's hit single \\\"Brother\\\" in 2009, selling over 45,000 copies there, whereas in Australia, it is the longest-running number-one single since \\\"I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair)\\\" by Sandi Thom in 2006 and the best-selling single of 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Party Rock Anthem\\\" is a mostly electronic composition. It topped the 7 million downloads mark in the United States in July 2012, becoming the second fastest song in digital history to reach this plateau (in 68 weeks) just behind Adele's \\\"Rolling in the Deep\\\" which achieved it in 67 weeks, and the third-biggest selling digital single since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital sales in 2003. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and remained there for six straight weeks. The song spent 68 weeks on the chart, becoming the third most total weeks on Billboard Hot 100 history. It has also sold 7,463,000 copies in the US as of January 2013, and over one million copies in the UK.

One sided test pressings (not mis-presses, but used in the trade) escaped the pressing plant and are on the market.\\r\\nThe song opens with an overdriven bass solo played by Lemmy. For the lyrics, he said he \\\"used gambling metaphors, mostly cards and dice – when it comes to that sort of thing, I'm more into the one-arm bandits actually, but you can't really sing about spinning fruit, and the wheels coming down\\\".\\r\\nOn 6 September 1980 Lemmy was interviewed by Graham Neale on BBC Radio 1's Rock On Saturday show, \\\"Bomber\\\", \\\"Ace of Spades\\\" and \\\"Love Me Like a Reptile\\\" were played. The following month, on 6 and 20 October, the band played the song on BBC TV show Top of the Pops.\\r\\nIn the studio version, the last lines of the bridge are \\\"I don't want to live forever/And don't forget the Joker\\\".

The re-released Visionary single charted at number 19 in the UK. The piece is one of Jackson's signature songs, and has appeared on numerous greatest hits albums, including Number Ones, The Essential Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection, King of Pop, This Is It, and Immortal (for the New version of song).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song also serves as the theme song to Jackson's 1988 film Moonwalker.

He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, passers-by then repeatedly bump into him (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the bonnet of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of The Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" in 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence's debut studio album, Fallen. The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lee, \\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist's life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee's vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the inclusion of \\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp Stölzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accompanying music video for \\\"Bring Me to Life\\\" was directed by Philipp Stölzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, Stölzl said: \\\"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul's arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Smack My Bitch Up\\\" is a song by British big beat group the Prodigy. It was released in November 1997 as the third and final single from the album The Fat of the Land. The song was voted by Mixmag readers as the third greatest dance record of all time. Although the song wasn't as big a commercial success as their previous singles, it gained a cult following.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song caused considerable controversy because of its allegedly misogynistic title and its video, which depicted scenes of drunken and drug-fuelled sexual excess and violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the release of the single, Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.\"\n",

There are shots of Roy Stride wandering around town and seeing people with Elvis haircuts and wearing the sorts of clothes he wore. At the end of the video he sees the girl that he is attracted to and the song fades with the words \\\"Elvis has left the building. Thank you and goodnight!\\\", a line made famous by Elvis.\\r\\n\\r\\nChart performance\\r\\nOn 16 December 2007, \\\"Elvis Ain't Dead\\\" debuted in the UK Top 40 at #33 in the UK Singles Chart via download sales alone. From then on, it slowly crept up the charts. It rose five places to #28 in its first week of physical release, then two places up to #26 the next week, climbed a further nine places to #17 in its third week and it then jumped another seven places to #10 in its fourth week, hence becoming the band's second UK Top 10 single.

       "[1] \"\\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) and appearing on her international debut album, Kiss. The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on 20 September 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content. \\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position in Canada, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007's \\\"Girlfriend\\\" by Avril Lavigne. With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, \\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" is one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, the singer has performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. \\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Nickelback, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, Glee and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on the season premiere episode, \\\"The New Rachel\\\", of the fourth season of Glee. The song used in in other television shows, Castle, Jane by Design, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and 90210.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, which will be held on 10 February 2013. On 11 December 2012, \\\"Call Me Maybe\\\" was named Song of the Year of 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard Magazine ranked this song #2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 Songs charts, in each case behind \\\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\\", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice's annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling 10 million copies in that year alone, and best-selling single in iTunes Store in 2012.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"I'm Yours\\\" is the first single released by American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz from his third studio album We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. (2008) The song was originally released on a limited edition EP called Extra Credit as a demo in 2005 to promote his second studio album Mr. A–Z. It was performed in his 2004 and 2005 gigs and already became a crowd favorite before its release. \\\"I'm Yours\\\" was nominated for Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards. It was also used for the Australian Seven Network's promotion of the season premiere of Packed to the Rafters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm Yours\\\" was immensely successful in the US on the Billboard charts. At 76 weeks on the Hot 100, it held the record for most weeks spent on the chart, breaking the previous record of 69 weeks set by LeAnn Rimes' song \\\"How Do I Live\\\" in 1998; this record has since been broken by Imagine Dragons' \\\"Radioactive\\\", which spent 87 weeks on the chart, and AWOLNATION's \\\"Sail\\\", which spent 79 weeks on the chart. As of January 2013, it is the tenth best-selling digital song of all time in the US, selling over 6 million downloads, and 12.2 million worldwide. It remains Mraz's biggest US hit single to date. The song was used as an 'inspiration' for the Bollywood movie Nautanki Saala song \\\"Mera Mann Kehne Laga\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMraz first launched the song from the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, at Michele Clark's Sunset Sessions in 2008. He also sang a version on Sesame Street titled \\\"Outdoors\\\" and released a successful remixed version featuring Lil Wayne and Jah Cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nComposition\\r\\nAccording to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of C major (recorded a half-step lower in B major). The majority of the song contains the I-V-vi-IV progression.\\r\\n\\r\\nChart performance\\r\\nThroughout 2008, \\\"I'm Yours\\\" slowly increased in airplay and digital sales and would go on to become Mraz's biggest hit to date, charting higher than his previous pop hit, 2003's \\\"The Remedy (I Won't Worry)\\\". It became his first top ten single in the US, peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Pop 100. On the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart the song was number one for a total of nine weeks. The single later received Mainstream Top 40 airplay, eventually topping that chart as well. Due to its gradually building crossover appeal, the song has had extremely unusual longevity, not reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40 until December 2008, ten months after its release and seven months after it debuted on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. In fact, VH1 had already retired the song in early October 2008 after a 20-week run. The song returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 for the third time in its 38th week on the chart. \\\"I'm Yours\\\" would go on to chart for a total of 76 weeks, making this the longest chart run in Billboard magazine history, up until the 87-week run of Imagine Dragons' \\\"Radioactive\\\" and the 79-week run of AWOLNATION's \\\"Sail\\\", both set in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year into its release, it topped another chart for the first time, when it hit number one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks during the week of February 5, 2009. This marked 11 months since the song had topped its first chart in the US, when it reached number one on the Triple A chart in March 2008. \\\"I'm Yours\\\" spent 16 weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, after topping the Adult Contemporary chart, \\\"I'm Yours\\\" became the first song to top the Triple A, Adult Top 40, Mainstream Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts. Despite weak initial download sales, it became the eighth best-selling digital song in the United States by January 2012. It has sold 6,837,000 copies in the US as of April 23, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is Mraz's most successful global single to date, reaching number one in Sweden and Norway, and the top ten in Canada, United States, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It was also able to reach number one on the Top 40 Digital Track Chart in Australia. In Hawaii, radio stations do play the original version, along with a Hawaiian remix of the song. \\\"I'm Yours\\\" has also been a huge hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number one, knocking off \\\"Poker Face\\\" which spent ten consecutive weeks at number one. It was certified Gold after nine weeks selling over 7,500 copies and then certified Platinum after 14 weeks selling over 15,000 copies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm Yours\\\" made its debut on the British singles chart on December 12, 2008, at number 78 and then slowly climbed up the chart until it peaked at number 11. It spent the whole of 2009 on the chart apart from the final two weeks of the year, then re-entered in January 2010 and again in August, and has now clocked up 56 weeks on the official UK Top 75, making it currently the 15th longest runner of all time and the longest never to make the Top 10, at 84 weeks on the Top 100.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Creep\\\" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. Radiohead released \\\"Creep\\\" as their debut single in 1992, and it later appeared on their first album, Pablo Honey (1993). During its initial release, \\\"Creep\\\" was not a chart success. However, upon re-release in 1993, it became a worldwide hit. Attendees of Radiohead's early gigs often exhibited little interest in the band's other songs, causing the band to react against \\\"Creep\\\" and play it less often during the mid-to-late 1990s. It is included in the Radiohead: The Best Of compilation album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artwork for the single is a painting by Maurice Burns, called \\\"Craigavon Under Age Drinkers Rule\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, Thom Yorke wrote \\\"Creep\\\" while studying at Exeter University in the late 1980s. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said that the song was inspired by a girl that Yorke had followed around who showed up unexpectedly during a show by the band.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, during rehearsal sessions with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, Radiohead spontaneously performed \\\"Creep\\\". Yorke described \\\"Creep\\\" to the producers as \\\"our Scott Walker song\\\"; Slade and Kolderie mistook the singer's remark and believed the song was a cover. After tension arose due to unsatisfactory attempts at recording other songs, Slade and Kolderie tried to improve morale by requesting Radiohead to play \\\"Creep\\\" again. The band recorded the song in a single take; after the performance everyone in the room burst into applause. Once the band assured Kolderie that \\\"Creep\\\" was an original song, he called EMI to tell them to consider the song as Radiohead's next single. While the recording had minimal overdubs and the band did not intend to release it, the producers were impressed with the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to similarities to \\\"The Air That I Breathe\\\", a song recorded by the Hollies in 1973, Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood are credited as co-writers of \\\"Creep\\\". \\\"Creep\\\" uses a chord progression used in \\\"The Air That I Breathe\\\" in its verse and a melody from \\\"The Air That I Breathe\\\" in the bridge following the second chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe G–B–C–Cm chord progression is repeated throughout the whole song, just alternating between arpeggiated chords in the verses and last chorus and loud power chords during the first two choruses. In G major, these may be interpreted as \\\"I–III–IV–iv\\\". According to Guy Capuzzo, the ostinato musically portrays \\\"the song's obsessive lyrics, which depict the 'self-lacerating rage of an unsuccessful crush'.\\\" For example, the \\\"highest pitches of the ostinato form a prominent chromatic line that 'creeps' up, then down, involving scale degrees {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {5}}} \\\\hat 5– ♯ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {5}}} \\\\hat 5– {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {6}}} \\\\hat 6– ♭ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {6}}} \\\\hat 6.... ascend, the lyrics strain towards optimism...descend, the subject sinks back into the throes of self-pity...The guitarist's fretting hand mirrors this contour\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the song shifts from the verse to the chorus, Jonny Greenwood plays three blasts of guitar noise (\\\"dead notes\\\" played by releasing fret-hand pressure and picking the strings). Greenwood said he did this because he did not like how quiet the song was; he explained: \\\"So I hit the guitar hard—really hard\\\". Ed O'Brien said: \\\"That's the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn't like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song.\\\" During the song's outro, Jonny Greenwood plays a piano figure. Kolderie forgot to add the piano part during the final mix until the end of the song, but the band approved of the final result.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Yorke, \\\"Creep\\\" tells the tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the attention of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about \\\"Creep\\\" in 1993, Yorke said: \\\"I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it.\\\" Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about \\\"recognizing what you are\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe version issued for US radio play replaced the line \\\"So fucking special\\\" with \\\"So very special\\\". The group was worried that issuing a censored version would be a \\\"bit of a sellout\\\" according to Jonny Greenwood, but they decided it was acceptable since their idols Sonic Youth had done the same thing. Nonetheless, Greenwood noted the British press \\\"weren't impressed\\\" by the action. During the recording session for the censored lyrics, Kolderie convinced Yorke to rewrite the first verse, telling him he thought the singer could do better.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Feel Good Inc.\\\" is an alternative rock song by British virtual band Gorillaz. The song features rap verses by De La Soul and showcases the band's alternative hip hop influences, while also containing elements of drum and bass and funk rock. The lyrical themes of the song revolve around isolation and escapism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was the lead single from the band's second studio album Demon Days on 9 May 2005. The single peaked at No. 2 in the United Kingdom and No. 14 in the United States, the band's highest chart positions to date. It also topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks, a first for the band. This is the only song in Damon Albarn's career to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked in the top 10 in 17 countries, reaching No. 1 in Spain. The song was listed in Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone's Best Songs of the 2000s. The song won Best Pop Collaboration at the 2006 Grammy Awards. In an interview during promotion for The Singles Collection 2001–2011, Murdoc described it as \\\"the song that launched a million iPods\\\" and \\\" first song ever to chart on downloads alone, infamous soundtrack to the iPod advert, Grammy award winner, backing track for Madonna's first holographic poledance.\\\" This song has surpassed \\\"Clint Eastwood\\\" to be Gorillaz's most successful single worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview from Gorillaz' \\\"iTunes Session\\\" in 2010, band member 2D states that the inspiration for the song came from the time he was \\\"passing the wind turbines out near Palm Springs. He believed he was going to the Coachella festival or something, and he passed a huge field full of those wind turbines farming the land ... so he started really with the chorus section and then built it up from there.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the video, while the camera is rising up from the Feel Good Inc. tower, a sample of the Spacemonkeyz dub of \\\"Clint Eastwood\\\" entitled \\\"A Fistful of Peanuts\\\" can be heard. The main themes of the video are intellectual freedom and the media's dumbing down of mass culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the video, 2D yearns for the freedom to join Noodle on her floating island. The characters lying on the floor represent those who have already been \\\"dumbed down\\\", while the band members are the ones who have awakened. 2D is trying to wake all the people from their half-dead state by yelling at them through his megaphone, in the style of a political activist. Jamie Hewlett said in an interview that the inspiration for some scenes in the video came from Hayao Miyazaki; specifically, the windmill-powered landmass, which has been compared to that of Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. The floating island is chased by ominous helicopters, which closely resemble Korean War era Bell H-13s, monitoring the behaviour inside and ensuring that no one escapes. It is unclear whether they are preventing Noodle's escape or are chasing her away. Back in the tower, De La Soul appear as larger-than life, seemingly omnipotent images on surrounding television screens, laughing at the Gorillaz band members. Their taunting drives 2D into a wild, hypnotic frenzy as he tries to resist the urge to be dumbed down. At the end of the video, 2D appears beaten by his surroundings, and returns to the state he was in when the video began, repeating the words \\\"Feel good\\\" until the video finally ends, in an exact reversal of the intro. The repetition of \\\"Feel good\\\" represents that 2D is convincing himself that everything is OK (as if he is brainwashing himself to believe it), instead of facing the harsh truth of the situation. The music video for \\\"El Mañana\\\" is a continuation of this video, depicting two helicopter gunships catching up to Noodle's floating windmill island and attacking it.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Empire State of Mind\\\" is a song by American rapper Jay-Z, featuring vocals and a chorus from American singer Alicia Keys. It was released as the third single from Jay-Z's 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009), by his Roc Nation label in October 2009. The song is an anthemic ode to both artists' native New York, and features a music sample of \\\"Love on a Two-Way Street\\\" (1970), written by Sylvia Robinson and Bert Keyes and performed by The Moments. \\\"Empire State of Mind\\\" was originally written by Brooklyn natives Angela Hunte and Jane't \\\"Jnay\\\" Sewell-Ulepic who were feeling homesick while on an overseas trip in February 2009. The following month they sent the song in for consideration at Roc Nation, although it received negative reviews. Initially discouraged, the duo sent the song to Jay-Z after a suggestion by an associate of EMI Music Publishing (EMI), and after an incident which they described as an omen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hearing the song, Jay-Z immediately recorded it, changing all of the verses but keeping the hook. The single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song's hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song's piano loop. The song was viewed as being an \\\"orchestral rap ballad\\\" and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to drugs, locations in New York and its famous residents, and describes the city's essence. Profanity is also present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was included in multiple critics' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times. The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. \\\"Empire State of Mind\\\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including; the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Italy and Sweden. The single was commercially successful in the United States, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Jay-Z's first number-one single on the chart as a lead artist. It appeared in 2009 year-end charts in Italy, Australia and the US. The song is also the last number one hit of the 2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the song's music video, which is primarily in black-and-white, Jay-Z and Keys are shown performing the song in various locations in New York. \\\"Empire State of Mind\\\" has been performed by Jay-Z and Keys multiple times, including during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2009 American Music Awards. Usually when the duo performs the song, an overhead screen shows images of places in New York. Keys has recorded a sequel entitled \\\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\\", which is featured on her fourth studio album The Element of Freedom (2009). Her version was positively received by critics and did well commercially, but was not as successful as its predecessor, but it was Top 10 in three countries in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland. She said that she chose to record her own version of \\\"Empire State of Mind\\\" because she wanted to express her own personal feelings about New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single has sold 5 million copies to date.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Fix You\\\" is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was written by all four members of the band for their third album, X&Y. The track is built around an organ, that is accompanied by slow tempo drums, and a vocals. It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&Y and has reached number four in the United Kingdom Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US.\\r\\nBlythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's mother-in-law, stated in an interview in May 2012 that Chris Martin 'wrote the song Fix You for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it'.\\r\\n\\\"Fix You\\\" received positive reviews. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The song, itself, was nominated for multiple awards in the categories of Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Anthem of the Summer. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\\r\\nThe guitar solo of \\\"Fix You\\\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens' home games.\\r\\nThe song was played live to a motionless crowd at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, CA.\\r\\n\\\"Fix You\\\" covered by Boyce Avenue was used in the video \\\"Internet Love Story: CTFxC Wedding (Charles & Alli)\\\" uploaded by user charlestrippy on 22 November 2011. As of 27 April 2012 it currently has 2,330,161 views.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for \\\"Fix You\\\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \\\"In My Place\\\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band's first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete. In the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \\\"Make Trade Fair\\\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of X&Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King's Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin's walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song's finale. The audience sings along with the song's final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.\"\n",

It was released on September 13, 2016 by EarDrummers and Interscope Records as the third single from their second studio album SremmLife 2. The song features guest vocals from American rapper Gucci Mane, and is produced by Mike Will Made It. It is both Rae Sremmurd's and Gucci Mane's first number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100, and also marks their first top ten appearance in territories such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was one of the last tracks recorded and a big part of the reason for delaying the original June album release date.\\r\\nOn September 22, 2016, the music video for \\\"Black Beatles\\\" was released on Rae Sremmurd's Vevo account on YouTube. It was directed by Motion Family.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Hello\\\" is a song by British singer Adele. It was released on 23 October 2015 by XL Recordings as the lead single from her third studio album, 25 (2015). Adele co-wrote the song with her producer, Greg Kurstin. \\\"Hello\\\" is a piano ballad with soul influences, and lyrics that discuss themes of nostalgia and regret. Upon release, the song was well received by music critics, who compared it favourably to Adele's previous work and praised the song's lyrics and Adele's vocals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hello\\\" attained international commercial success reaching number one in almost every country it charted in, including the United Kingdom, where it became her second UK number-one single, following \\\"Someone like You\\\", and has the largest opening week sales in three years. In the United States, \\\"Hello\\\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Adele's fourth number-one on the chart and breaking several records, including becoming the first song to sell over a million digital copies in a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Xavier Dolan and co-stars Adele and Tristan Wilds. The music video for the song broke the Vevo Record by achieving over 27.7 million views within a 24-hour span, held previously by Taylor Swift's \\\"Bad Blood\\\" which accumulated 20.1 million views in that timeframe. It also broke the record for shortest time to attain 100 million Vevo views, previously held by Miley Cyrus' \\\"Wrecking Ball\\\", as well as shortest time to reach 1 billion YouTube views (88 days). Adele promoted the song with a live performance on a BBC one-hour special, entitled Adele at the BBC.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Take Me to Church\\\" is a song by Irish musician Hozier for his debut extended play (EP) Take Me to Church (2013), as well as his self-titled debut album (2014). The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier's frustration with the Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. It first caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track, Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"Magic\\\" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay for their sixth studio album, Ghost Stories (2014). It was written and produced by band members Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, Chris Martin, with production assistance from Paul Epworth, Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson. The song was released as the lead single from Ghost Stories on 3 March 2014, by Parlophone. A beat consisting of a \\\"muffled snare\\\" and \\\"dusty bass riff\\\" is repeated throughout most of the song. As the song progresses, an organ is later added to the instrumentation which is eventually swapped out for a stomp-clap beat and again for a synth beat. Following the song's second chorus, these beats are gradually combined together while Martin sings in falsetto. The song's \\\"anticlimactic\\\" portion then decreases intensity until it has eventually resumed to simply a snare and bass riff.\\r\\nThe song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013, at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London, England, both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums, 2008's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011's Mylo Xyloto respectively. The song's bass riff, the first part of the song, was originally conceived by Guy Berryman during the band's recording sessions in February 2013. The song was then covered by singer/songwriter Lauren Aquilina for her BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session.\"\n",

       "[1] \"\\\"We Can't Stop\\\" is a song by American recording artist Miley Cyrus for her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). It was released on June 3, 2013 by RCA Records as the lead single from the album, following Cyrus' departure from Hollywood Records in early 2013. \\\"We Can't Stop\\\" was written by Mike L. Williams II, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Timothy Thomas and Theron Thomas (known collectively as Rock City), Cyrus, Douglas Davis and Ricky Walters. The song was produced by Williams II under his production name, Mike Will Made-It, with co-production from P-Nasty and vocal production by Rock City. \\\"We Can't Stop\\\" is a pop, R&B, and dance song that lyrically talks of a house party.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its release, \\\"We Can't Stop\\\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and lyrics. It peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. In doing so, it tied Cyrus' earlier song \\\"Party in the U.S.A.\\\" as her highest-peaking track in the country, where it has exceeded sales of two million copies. Internationally, the track enjoyed similar success, topping national singles charts in territories including New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Diane Martel and was released on June 19, 2013. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on Cyrus' increasingly provocative image. Thirty-seven days after its premiere, it became the fastest clip to reach 100 million views across Vevo platforms. \\\"We Can't Stop\\\" was additionally promoted with a highly-controversial performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased on June 19, 2013, and directed by Diane Martel, the video portrays Cyrus and her friends at a house party and, according to her, is inspired by true events. The video starts with Miley cutting off a house-arrest ankle bracelet and putting on gold teeth accessories. It also shows Cyrus making out with a doll of herself in a pool, doing her infamous \\\"twerking\\\", dancing with a giant teddy bear; and other bizarre scenes, such as a skull made out of french fries, cutting off fake fingers in the kitchen, a mountain of bread, a computer-animated mask, and smoke coming out of a man's crotch. The video shows vibrant colors. This aspect of Cyrus' video was praised by critics, along with its creativity. The Director's Cut version has new scenes of Cyrus that weren't seen on the original video, such as the singing karaoke scenes.\"\n",

It was first released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of his second studio album, David Bowie. It became one of Bowie's signature songs and one of four of his songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\r\n",

       "Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later and would become the first manned moon landing another five days after that. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which was and still is an unmanned project. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and possibly the music video for \"Blackstar\".\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "\"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie's first single to chart in the UK. It reached the top five on its initial release and received the 1970 Ivor Novello Special Award for Originality. His second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song became Bowie's first UK No. 1 single.\r\n",

       "In December 1972, Mick Rock shot a video of Bowie miming to the June 1969 recording of the song, during the sessions for Aladdin Sane. The resulting music video was used to promote the 1973 US reissue of the \"Space Oddity\" single on RCA.

So after we recorded it, I thought, 'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,' and it just became everybody's favorite song. ...

It is the second single from the singer's sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims to what the song's lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline by guitarist David Williams, and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "The song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \"Billie Jean\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Awarded numerous honors—including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame—the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV's racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson's Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \"moonwalk\" also helped to popularize the song. It was also promoted through Jackson's Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson's scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \"Billie Jean\" sealed Jackson's status as an international pop icon.\r\n",
       "Jackson stated several times that \"Billie Jean\" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5. \"Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s.\" He added: \"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\"\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Jackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that \"Billie Jean\" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic \\& The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Following the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.\r\n",
       "Michael Jackson wrote \"Billie Jean\" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: \"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\" The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: \"The kid probably saved our lives.\"\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Jackson faced numerous disagreements with the song's co-producer. It has been reported that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. \"I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'\" Jones later recalled. \"He said: 'But that's the jelly!''That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\" Jones also wanted to change the track's title to \"Not My Lover\", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the demo tape sounded exactly like the finished product. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Having resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson's entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, \"'Billie Jean' is hot on every level. It's (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It's hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It's hot melodically  lyrically  vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.\"\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "The song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times — unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: \"sonic personality\". \"What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat\" Swedien later wrote. \"The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is.\" He concluded, \"But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean' — and that I attribute to sonic personality.\"\r\n",
       "\"Billie Jean\" blends elements of post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson's quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "According to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording “We Are the World,” Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for \"Billie Jean\" from a Hall \\& Oates song (apparently referring to Hall's \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): \"Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn't mind that he copied that groove.\" Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, \"it's something we all do.\"\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "According to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of \"Billie Jean\", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, \"oh no\". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto \"hee hee\". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child. & https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tqqsur1418298940.jpg & NA &  & http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi\\_XLOBDo\\_Y  & Steve Barron    &  & NA                                                                            & NA                                                                            & NA                                                                            & 128634833  & 321232  & 10269  & NA & NA     & 6 & 5 & 8.23077 & 13 & 1246105 & 7529099  & cb052235-5107-4988-ac2f-10404025c663 & f32fab67-77dd-3937-addc-9062e28e4c37 & f27ec8db-af05-4f36-916e-3d57f91ecf5e & unlocked\\\\\n",

       "The music video for \"She's So Lovely\" is set in a bowling alley. Roy Stride is trying to attract the attentions of a pretty girl (Louise Glover), but she has a boyfriend already. While the boyfriend is there, Roy tells the girl she looks beautiful. The boyfriend gets angry, but gets called away for his throw. As he scores a strike, Roy and the girl walk off down the hall together (although only their legs are shown, the shoes and jeans are the same as Roy's).
